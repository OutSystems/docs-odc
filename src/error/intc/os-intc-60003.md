# OS-INTC-60003

## Error message

`Something went wrong. Try reloading the page. If the problem persists, open a support case.`

## Cause

OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) can't find the entity inside a container when validating the name of an attribute. For example, this can happen when selecting an entity or an attribute on the **Select entities** screen.

## Impact

The screen might present some unexpected behaviors, such as an incorrect checkbox state on the attributes table or the selected entities and attributes don't save correctly.

## Recommended action

Reload the page, by clicking the browser's refresh button. Then repeat this operation.<br/>
If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-INTC-60003).

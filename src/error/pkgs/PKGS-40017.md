# OS-PKGS-40017

## Error message

`Unsupported package <packageName>.`

## Cause

The requested package is unsupported (it contains a dependency on an older version of a built-in app) and, therefore, cannot be installed.

## Impact

Unable to install the selected package.

## Recommended action

Select another package for installation.
If this happens on a newly created package or in any other instance where it shouldn't (for example, when the asset depends on an older version of Sample Data that is no longer available), create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-PKGS-40017).

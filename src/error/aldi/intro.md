# App or library dependency errors

These errors relate to OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) App or library dependencies. If you or someone else removes an App or library that your app uses from your organization, the dependency is no longer valid. This causes a problem with your app or library that you need to resolve.

Follow the instructions provided to fix the issue.

# OS-ELG-MODL-05001

## Error message

`No valid .NET 6 assembly found in your file.`

## Cause

No valid .NET 6 assembly found in your file.

## Impact

You must fix this error in your C# project before you can publish the external library. Once you've fixed it, you must create and upload a new ZIP file.

## Recommended action

Check that your project uses the .NET 6.0 framework and you [packaged the published project into a ZIP correctly](../../eap/building-apps/external-logic/README.md).

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-ELG-MODL-05001).

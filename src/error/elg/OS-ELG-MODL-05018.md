# OS-ELG-MODL-05018

## Error message

`The class that implements the interface decorated with OSInterface '<InterfaceName>' must be public.`

## Cause

The error occurs because the class implementing the interface decorated with `OSInterface` isn't public.

## Impact

You must fix this error in your C# project before you can publish the external library. Once you've fixed it, you must create and upload a new ZIP file.

## Recommended action

To solve this error, ensure that the implementing class is public. For example, if you have an interface `IMyInterface` decorated with `OSInterface`:

    [OSInterface]
    public interface IMyInterface {
        // Interface methods
    }

Make sure the class that implements this interface is public:

    public class MyImplementation : IMyInterface {
        // Implement interface methods
    }

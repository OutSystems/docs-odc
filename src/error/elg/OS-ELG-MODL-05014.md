# OS-ELG-MODL-05014

## Error message

`More than one structure, '<StructureName>', was found with the name '<Name>'.`

## Cause

The error occurs because multiple structures are using the same name in the `Name` parameter of the `OSStructure` attribute.

## Impact

You must fix this error in your C# project before you can publish the external library. Once you've fixed it, you must create and upload a new ZIP file.

## Recommended action

To solve this issue, you should ensure that each structure with the `OSStructure` attribute has a unique name. For example:

**Before**

    [OSStructure(Name = "MyStructure")]
    public struct MyStructure1
    {
        public int Value;
    }

    [OSStructure(Name ="MyStructure")]
    public struct MyStructure2
    {
        public float Value;
    }

**After**

    [OSStructure(Name = "MyStructure1")]
    public struct MyStructure1
    {
        public int Value;
    }

    [OSStructure(Name = "MyStructure2")]
    public struct MyStructure2
    {
        public float Value;
    }


In the corrected example, the `OSStructure` attribute names are unique: `MyStructure1` and `MyStructure2`. This resolves the error.

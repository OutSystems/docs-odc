# Firebase Cloud Messaging plugin using server actions

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article applies only to Firebase Cloud Messaging plugin version 1.0.0 and newer. The newer versions use [server actions](#server-actions-reference) to manage the notifications.

If you are still using Firebase Cloud Messaging plugin version 0.1.2 and older, OutSystems recommends that you migrate to version 1.0.0 and newer by June 2024.
 
</div>

The [Firebase Cloud Messaging plugin](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/12174/cloud-messaging-plugin-firebase) allows you to set a notification experience that starts the Firebase cross-platform messaging solution. This plugin lets you send normal and silent notifications to your mobile app users. Normal notifications can include customizable actions and sounds.

Normal notifications have a UI that displays visual and auditory cues. The cues either display in the app's notifications area or in the app's scope. Silent notifications don't display any visual cues. Notifications can deliver a data package to the app (called extra data) in the form of a key-value pairs list.

OutSystems also has notification features you can use to create custom actions and custom sounds.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

You can install the Firebase Cloud Messaging Plugin from the Forge in ODC Portal.

</div>

Normal notifications have a UI that displays visual and auditory cues. The cues either display in the notifications area of the app or in the scope of the app. Silent notifications don't display any visual cues. Notifications can deliver a data package to the app (called extra data) in the form of a key-value pairs list.

OutSystems also has notification features you can use to create custom actions and custom sounds.  

Following is a high-level process describing how to implement and manage the notifications of your OutSystems app.

1. Use the **Firebase Cloud Messaging Plugin’s Server Actions** to set up a back-end notification service.

1. Use the **Firebase Cloud Messaging Plugin's Client Actions** to implement basic notification functions in your app.

1. To prevent app runtime errors, verify if the plugin is available during runtime in your app. To check the availability of your plugin, from Service Studio, go to **Logic** > **Client Actions** > **CloudMessagingPlugin** > **CheckCloudMessagingPlugin** action. If the plugin isn't available in your app, display an error to your end-users.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

To learn how to install and reference a plugin in your OutSystems apps, and how to install a sample app, see [Installing a plugin and adding a public element to your app](../intro.md#installing-a-plugin-and-adding-a-public-element-to-your-app). To use this plugin, verify your app meets all the [Firebase prerequisites](intro.md#prerequisites).

</div>

## Sample app

OutSystems provides a sample app that contains logic for common use cases. Install the Firebase sample app from Forge and then open it in ODC Studio.

This sample app shows you how to do the following:

* Trigger a basic notification, leading to internal routes.

* Trigger a notification with custom actions that lead to internal routes.

* Trigger a notification with custom actions that lead to a given URL in the device’s browser.

* Trigger a notification with custom actions that lead to an external app.

* Trigger a notification with custom actions that open a text field.

* Trigger a notification with a custom sound.

## Compose and manage push notifications

The following steps describe how to create a back-end notification service and how to prepare a mobile app to respond with push notifications:

1. [Set up a back-end notification service using the send Notifications Server Actions](#setup-back-end).

1. [Enable basic notification functions in your app using the plugin's actions](#enable-notifications-plugins).

1. [Enable notifications with custom actions](#enable-custom-actions).

1. [Enable notifications with custom sounds](#enable-custom-sounds).

1. [Enable notifications with a custom icon and icon color for Android devices](#custom-android-notification).

1. [Manage the experience of in-app notifications using the Notifications block](#manage-notification-ux).

1. [Manage the experience of custom actions using the Notifications block](#manage-custom-actions-ux).

1. [Extend to your use case: authenticate your notification requests to FCM HTTP v1 REST API](#custom-notification-requests).

### Set up a back-end notification service { #setup-back-end }

<div class="info" markdown="1">

The Cloud Messaging Configurator, version 0.1.2 and older, is deprecated. For more information, see [Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTP protocol](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref). This means the **v2** and **v1** endpoints will no longer be functional.

The Cloud Messaging Configurator's REST APIs have been replaced by server actions available on the Firebase Cloud Messaging Plugin. If you are consuming these APIs, they must be replaced with the server actions as soon as possible.

</div>

To set up a back-end notification service, do the following:

1. Install the **Cloud Messaging Plugin** from [Forge] forge component in your environment. 
    This component includes four **Server Actions** that allow you to send notifications to a list of users or topics and one **Server Action** to generate an **Access Token**.

1. Create a new app to serve as your backend notification service.

   This app can be a Reactive Web or Mobile app.

1. In the newly created application, consume the **Firebase Cloud Messaging Plugin** and add the server Actions, along with its associated static entities.
   
   ![Screenshot showing how to import the Server Actions.](images/fcm-server-actions-import.png "Firebase Messaging Cloud Plugin Server Actions Import")
   ![Screenshot showing how to import the Static Entities.](images/fcm-static-entities-import.png "Firebase Messaging Cloud Plugin Static Entities Import")

   
1. Get your Firebase Service Account File via **Firebase Console > Settings > Service Accounts > Generate new private key**
   
   ![Screenshot showing how to access the Firebase Service Account File.](images/firebase-service-account-generation.png "Firebase Service Account File access")

1. Update the plugin’s settings with the information inside this service account JSON File

    1. In ODC Portal, go to the Details page of your app.

    1. Navigate to the Configurations tab, and expand the Settings section.

    1. For the **PrivateKey** setting, copy/paste the value of the private_key field of your Firebase Service Account JSON File.

    1. For the **PrivateKeyID** setting, copy/paste the value of the private_key_id field of your Firebase Service Account JSON File.

    1. For the **FirebaseProjectInfo** setting, open your Service Account File in your text editor of choice, remove private_key_id and private_key fields and copy/paste the resulting JSON.

        The Original Service Account JSON format is: 
        ```JSON
        { 
            "type": "service_account",
            "project_id": "<your-id>",
            "private_key_id": "<your-private-key-id",
            "private_key": "<your-private-key",
            "client_email": "<your-client-email>",
            "client_id": "<your-client-id",
            "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
            "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
            "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "<cert-url>",
            "client_x509_cert_url": "<client-cert-url",
            "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
        }
         ```
        While the FirebaseProjectInfo JSON setting should be:
        ```JSON
        { 
            "type": "service_account",
            "project_id": "<your-id>",
            "client_email": "<your-client-email>",
            "client_id": "<your-client-id",
            "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
            "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
            "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "<cert-url>",
            "client_x509_cert_url": "<client-cert-url",
            "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
        }
         ```
1. Create the logic to store and manage your Firebase Access Token in the app you just created.

    Call the new server action GetAcessToken and store its return value. This token expires after one hour and, to avoid calling the action GetAccessToken unnecessarily, its value, along with its creation time, should be stored in a Database table. Before calling the server action, check if the token has expired and only then refresh its value.

Now you can start to create the UI for your back-end notification service. For example, to send a notification to a user on the associated Firebase project (using an app with the Cloud Messaging plugin), associate the **SendNotificationToUsers** Server Action to a button and add logic to retrieve your Service Account file. 

If you want to send the notification to specific users, note that these are identified by their Firebase Token, that can be obtained with the **GetToken** client action. You can find this ID on the Firebase Project Settings under the Cloud Messaging tab. 

To send a notification to all users, or to all Android or iOS users, you need to fill the **SenderID** structure attribute of the **SendRequest** parameter. You can find this ID on the Firebase Project Settings under the Cloud Messaging tab. 

Moreover, to send a notification specifically to all Android or iOS users, you should set the **SendToPlatform** structure attribute to one of the values in the **Platform** static entity that the plugin provides.

![Image illustrating the configuration of Server Action call for Firebase Cloud Messaging](images/fcm-server-action-call.png "FCM Server Action Call Configuration")

Other available methods include **SendNotificationToTopics**, **SendSilentNotificationToUsers**, and **SendSilentNotificationToTopics**.

For silent notifications (**SendSilentNotificationToUsers** and **SendSilentNotificationToTopics**), the **TimeToLive** structure attribute sets the notifications' expiration time. More specifically, if the **TimeValue** for a specific **TimeUnit** is greater than 0, the message will persist in the local storage and be delivered at the first opportunity, until the expiration time has passed.

For topic notifications (**SendNotificationToTopics**, **SendSilentNotificationToTopics**), set the topics for which a notification will be delivered to in the **SendToTopics** structure attribute.

#### Sending notifications to a  100+ users list{ #send-notifications-limited-list }

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Starting from Firebase Cloud Messaging Plugin version 0.1.3 and onwards, sending notifications to an unlimited list of users is not supported. 

</div>

This section describes how you can send notifications to a big user list, using the **SendNotificationToUsers** and **SendSilentNotificationsToUsers** Server Actions. 

Both server actions have a limit of 100 users (**SendToUsers** parameter), throwing an Exception if a list exceeds this limit. To send notifications to a bigger user list, we recommend using asynchronous logic, with Timers.

Inside a Timer, you can iterate over your user list and send notifications to up to 100 users at a time. 

<div class="info" markdown="1">
To learn more about how to use Timers, see the [documentation](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/use_timers/).
</div>

## Enable basic notification functions in your app { #enable-notifications-plugins }

This section describes some of the actions that you can use to leverage notification functions on your mobile app.

On first use, you might want to register your users to receive notifications. For that, you can use the **RegisterDevice** action when your app opens. For example, if the user isn’t already registered, you can call the **RegisterDevice** action on the **OnReady** event of the app’s home screen. On first use, this action displays a native permission request and, upon user acceptance, the device is registered on the Firebase Cloud Messaging service, ready to receive notifications.

Alternatively, you can provide an explicit way to register and unregister the device from the Firebase cloud Messaging service using the **RegisterDevice** / **UnregisterDevice** actions. Then associate the actions to a UI element such as a toggle.

To prevent errors, it's a good practice to first check if the plugin is available using the **CheckCloudMessagingPlugin** action.

![Screenshot showing the logic flow for registering a device with Firebase Messaging](images/firebase-messaging-register-device-odcs.png "Firebase Messaging Register Device Logic")

After registering the device on the Firebase Cloud Messaging service, the active device's token becomes available and can be retrieved using the action **GetToken**. For iOS devices, the Apple Push Notification service token can also be retrieved, using the **GetAPNsToken** action.

To manage topic subscriptions, you can use the **Subscribe / Unsubscribe** actions. The user will need to set the topic name to which the app will subscribe (or unsubscribe). If the topic doesn't exist yet on the Firebase Cloud Messaging project, it creates a new one.

![Screenshot displaying the logic for adding a topic in Firebase Messaging](images/firebase-messaging-with-logic-of-add-topic-odcs.png "Firebase Messaging Add Topic Logic")

To retrieve all pending silent notifications, you can use the **GetPendingNotification** action. This action outputs a silent notifications list with Timestamp, MessageID, TimeToLive, and an ExtraData list of key-value pairs. Silent notifications are notifications that have no UI representation in the form of a visual or auditory stimulus in the app. Despite being silent, these notifications can deliver a data package to the app (called extra data), in the form of a list of key-value pairs.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Note that when receiving a silent notification without extra data and your app is in the background, the notification is not saved in the database, that is, it won’t be returned in the **GetPendingNotifications** action.

</div>

As part of the notification experience, the developer might want to control the badge number which is a value that appears on the top-right corner of the app icon. The way you control the badge number differs from operative system:

* For iOS you can use the **GetBadgeNumber** action to retrieve the current badge number and the **SetBadgeNumber** to specify a given number to be shown on the app icon badge.

* For Android you can only specify a given badge number after receiving a notification. Thus, you can use the **SendLocalNotification** action and set the badge number through the action parameter *BadgeNumber*.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Starting on Android 14, most devices do not show the badge number when long-pressing the app's icon.

</div>

![Screenshot of the action to set the badge number in Firebase Messaging](images/firebase-messaging-with-setting-badge-logic-odcs.png "Firebase Messaging Set Badge Number")

Finally, you might want to give the opportunity to your user to clear all the app's notifications remaining in the notification center. For this, you can associate the **ClearNotifications** action to a piece of UI, such as a button.

![Screenshot of the action to clear all notifications in Firebase Messaging](images/firebase-messaging-with-clear-notifications-logic-odcs.png "Firebase Messaging Clear Notifications")

### Enable notifications with custom actions { #enable-custom-actions }

To enhance your notification with custom actions you must use the **Plugin's Server Actions**, using the **ActionList** parameter inside the Notification parameter on the **SendNotificationToTopics** or **SendNotificationToUsers** Server Actions.

We offer the following types of custom actions:

* **Internal route** - Sends an event to be handled by the app, similar to a basic notification click.

    * For this action, you must check the **Manage the experience of custom actions**. 

* **Web route** - Opens a given URL in the device’s browser.

* **App route** - Opens a route in an external app.

* **Reply field** - Opens a text field that lets users send a text directly to the app.

### Enable notifications with custom sound { #enable-custom-sounds }

To enhance your notification with custom sounds,  follow these steps:

1. Put the .wav files you want to use as notification sounds into a .zip file called **sounds.zip**. 

1. Upload the .zip file to the app’s Resources folder. 

1. Use the **Plugin's Server Actions**, using the **Sound** parameter inside the **Notification** parameter on the **SendNotificationToTopics** or **SendNotificationToUsers methods**.

It is important to note the following requirements for custom sounds:

* Only .wav files are supported.

* The name of the zip sound file (.wav) can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. If you add any other characters, the android build won't work.

* The sounds.zip file should be included with the “Deploy Action” set to “Deploy to Target Directory”.

## Enable notifications with a custom icon and icon color - Android only {#custom-android-notification}

By default, a Cloud Messaging notification will use the app's launcher icon as the notification icon. However, for **Android** notifications, you can also define a custom icon and a custom icon color. 
To setup a custom icon and custom icon color for Android notifications, follow these steps:

1. Upload your custom icon (and it's various resolutions) to the resources of your application

    ![Screenshot showing the different custom icon resolutions in application's Resources](images/firebase-messaging-custom-icon-resources-odcs.png "Custom Android Icon Resources")

1. Update the Application's Extensibility Configuration JSON so that the different icon resolutions are added to their correct paths

```JSON
 "resources": {
        "android": {
            "AndroidResource": {
                "src": "www/google-services.json",
                "target": "app/google-services.json"
            },
            "NotificationIcon24": {
                "src": "www/icon/notification_icon_24.png",
                "target": "app/src/main/res/drawable-mdpi/notification_icon.png"
            },
            "NotificationIcon36": {
                "src": "www/icon/notification_icon_36.png",
                "target": "app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/notification_icon.png"
            },
            "NotificationIcon48": {
                "src": "www/icon/notification_icon_48.png",
                "target": "app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/notification_icon.png"
            },
            "NotificationIcon72": {
                "src": "www/icon/notification_icon_72.png",
                "target": "app/src/main/res/drawable-xxhdpi/notification_icon.png"
            },
            "NotificationIcon96": {
                "src": "www/icon/notification_icon_96.png",
                "target": "app/src/main/res/drawable-xxxhdpi/notification_icon.png"
            }
            
        }
    }
```

1. In your push notification request, either via the plugin's `SendNotificationToUsers` or `SendNotificationToTopic` Server Actions, specify the custom icon and color

    ![Screenshot showing Android notification configuration](images/fcm-custom-android-notification-odcs.png "Custom Android Icon and Color Configuration")

<div class="info" markdown="1">

* If no value for the custom **Icon** is passed, the app's launcher icon will be used, and the **Color** won't be applied.
* The value passed to **Color** must be a RGB HEX code (`#rrggbb`).

</div>

## Manage the experience of in-app notifications { #manage-notification-ux }

By default, a cloud messaging notification displays in the notification center. However, you can also display the notification in-app when the app is on the foreground. To enable this notification, you can use the **NotificationsHandler** block. This block triggers events that pass the parameters of both notifications and silent notifications to the context of the app.

You need to add this block to each screen that might handle the notification content.

Optionally, you can use the **NotificationDialog** block, which provides a notification dialog UI inside the app.

## Manage the experience of custom actions using the Notifications block. { #manage-custom-actions-ux }

By default, a cloud messaging notification displays in the notification center. However, you can also display the notification in-app when the app is in the foreground. To enable this you can use the **NotificationsHandler** block, using **InternalRouteActionClicked** for custom actions. This block triggers events that pass the parameters of both notifications and silent notifications to the context of the app.

Add this block to each screen that might handle the notification content.

## Manage the experience of notification clicks

When the end-user clicks on a notification in the notification center, the app opens by default. If you want your app to handle the notification click, you can use the **NotificationsHandler** block and define a handler for the **NotificationClicked** event.

If you want to navigate to a screen inside your app when the end-user clicks on a notification, you can use the **BuildInternalDeepLink** client action from the plugin. You should pass the name of the destination screen to the **Notification > DeepLink** attribute of the **SendRequest** parameter of the server action you called to deliver the notification (**SendNotificationToUsers** or **SendNotificationToTopics**). If you want the **BuildInternalDeepLink** action to build a deep link with query parameters, you should set the **key-value** pairs using the **ExtraDataList** attribute.

Our Sample App has this scenario implemented. If you want your app to do something else when the end-user clicks on a notification, simply implement your logic in the handler you create for the **NotificationClicked** event.


<div class="warning" markdown="1">

When sending a notification with a deep link, you should avoid using the following values for the **Key** attribute of **ExtraDataList**: from, notification, deepLink, showDialog, timeToLive, com.outsystems.fcm.notification, google.message_id, google.product_id, google.delivered_priority, google.original_priority, google.sent_time, google.ttl, gcm.n.analytics_data, collapse_key, FMOCA_TITLE, FMOCA_BODY, FMOCA_IMAGE, FMOCA_DATA.

</div>

## Optional setup for notification Channel Name and Description - Android only

By default, the Cloud Messaging plugin defines values for the notification channel name and description on local notifications. But in some instances, you might want to define a different default value by adding the following name and value properties on the extensibility configurations of your app:

```JSON
{
    "preferences": {
        "android": [
            {
                "name": "NotificationChannelDefaultName",
                "value": "This is my channel Name"
            },
            {
                "name": "NotificationChannelDefaultDescription",
                "value": "This is my channel Description"
            }
        ],
    }
}
```

The following image illustrates how the notification channel's name and description will appear in the user device:

![Screenshot of notification channel name and description](images/fcm-notification-channel.png "Notification Channel")

### Enable message delivery data export to BigQuery

BigQuery allows to:

* analyze the push notification data using BigQuery SQL
*  export it to another cloud provider
*  use the data for your custom ML models. 

Starting on version 2.1.0, the plugin offers a way to enable an app's message delivery data export to BigQuery. This is available through two client actions:
* `DeliveryMetricsExportToBigQueryEnabled`: Determines whether Firebase Cloud Messaging exports message delivery metrics to BigQuery.
* `SetDeliveryMetricsExportToBigQuery`: Enables or disables Firebase Cloud Messaging message delivery metrics export to BigQuery.

To have a better idea of what BigQuery is and how to enable it within the Firebase Console, please refer to the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/understand-delivery?platform=ios#bigquery-data-export).

The feature is disabled by default. To enable it, `SetDeliveryMetricsExportToBigQuery` needs to be called with its `Enable` input parameter set to `true`.

## Authenticate push notification requests to FCM HTTP v1 API {#custom-notification-requests}

Firebase Cloud Messaging offers a variety of uses cases with their HTTP v1 API which aren't covered by the Cloud Messaging Plugin's Server Actions, and as they can be very use-case specific, these Server Actions won't ever fully cover 100% of the HTTP v1 API. 

Nevertheless, starting from version `2.2.0` of the plugin, it's possible to use the token generated with the `GetAccessToken` Server Action to authenticate requests for Firebase's HTTP v1 API.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

* The generated access token expires after 1 hour.
* Refer to [Consume Rest APIs](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/integration_with_external_systems/rest/consume_rest_apis/) to learn more about how to consume Firebase's HTTP v1 REST API in an OutSystems App. 

</div>

#### Known limitations on iOS

As explained in the following [page](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/understand-delivery?platform=ios#enable-message-delivery-data-export), there are two ways to enable the data export on iOS, one for [alert](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/understand-delivery?platform=ios#enable_delivery_data_export_for_alert_notifications) and another for [background notifications](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/understand-delivery?platform=ios#enable_delivery_data_export_for_background_notifications). On OutSystems mobile apps, it is not possible to enable data export for alert notifications, so you won't be able to enable the feature for all notifications.

## Server actions reference

## Limitations

### On silent notifications

For iOS.

When a device has a low battery, apps don't process silent notifications.

For more information, see [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/).

### On subscribe to topic

For both iOS and Android.

Firebase SDKs for Android and iOS don't support subscribing to topics if the name contains spaces, like `TV Shows`.

### On Transitive Dependencies

Starting on version 4.0.0 of the plugin, builds of your app can fail if:
1. it contains a dependency to another app, mobile or web, that includes an asset from the Firebase Cloud Messaging plugin
2. the app doesn't include the necessary configuration files for Firebase plugins (e.g. google-services.json).

## On compatibility with Firebase Performance

For both iOS and Android.

Using the Firebase Cloud Messaging in combination with Firebase Performance requires v1.0.4 (or higher) of the latter.

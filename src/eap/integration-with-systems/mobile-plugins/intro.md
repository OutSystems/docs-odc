### Notes

When working with the plugins:

* Use the plugin that supports iOS or Android, depending on your target platform. The app creation fails if you use a plugin that isn't supported on the target platform. For more information on app generation errors check the [list of MABS errors](https://success.outsystems.com/support/errors/mabs_errors/).
* Each time you add, remove, or modify the plugin in an app, OutSystems creates a mobile package which you then have to distribute to the users for installation.
* Include the plugin license in your app to respect the license agreements of that plugin. These license agreements are usually placed in the About page of the app that uses them.

## Installing a plugin and adding a public element to your app { #adding-plugins }

The plugins are available from the Forge repository. To use a plugin in your app, you first need to install the plugin to your organization and add the plugin elements to your app.

To install a supported plugin from Forge:

1. Find the plugin you want to use in the [list of supported mobile plugins](#the-list-of-supported-mobile-plugins).

1. In **ODC Portal** > **Forge** find the plugin and open the details page.

1. Click **Install** and follow the instructions to install the plugin. Optionally, install the demo app that comes with the plugin.

1. Once the installation finishes, add the actions you want to use as public elements in your mobile app.

## Built-in plugins

All mobile apps generated by OutSystems include a native shell with the following built-in plugins that are used internally, handling a variety of housekeeping and infrastructure tasks. While you may see the names of these built-in plugins in the native mobile shell logs they're not user-configurable.

# Integrate with external data sources using Data Fabric

OutSystems Data Fabric simplifies access and integration of complex enterprise data into your app. You can aggregate information from hundreds of sources, such as Salesforce or SAP, eliminating the complexity of combining data across different systems.

Regardless of the external system youâ€™re integrating with, Data Fabric enables you to use [Aggregates](../../building-apps/data/fetch-data/aggregate.md) to query data seamlessly, as your data will be represented as [Entities](../../building-apps/data/modeling/entity.md).

How it works:

1. First, from the ODC Portal, admins [create connections](create-connection-external-data.md) to the external data source and select the entities. For the supported external data sources, refer to the [OutSystems system requirements for ODC](../../getting-started/system-requirements.md#supported-external-data-sources).
1. Then, in ODC studio, developers use Aggregates to fetch the data in their apps, having the option to [combine data from different data sources](../../building-apps/data/fetch-data/data-mash.md).

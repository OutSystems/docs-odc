# Automating CI/CD pipelines with OutSystems APIs

You can use OutSystems APIs to integrate with 3rd-party CI/CD tools like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) or [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops). This allows you to automate your entire CI/CD pipeline and manage the process from code to production.

By integrating OutSystems APIs with the automation tools you already use, you can improve your processes, enforce quality gates, and deliver reliable apps to your users faster.

As part of a CI/CD pipeline, you can use OutSystems APIs to:

1. [Select the revision and build of the asset you want to deploy](select-revision-build.md)  
2. [Deploy your asset to the target stage](deploy-asset.md)

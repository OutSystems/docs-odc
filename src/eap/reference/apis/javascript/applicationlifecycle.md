# ApplicationLifecycle

Provides information about the status of the application's lifecycle. Used to protect the app during upgrades, when local model access shouldn't be allowed, and to customize the application loading process.

Example:

```javascript
// Check if the app is currently being upgraded
var isUpgrading = $public.ApplicationLifecycle.isUpgradingVersion();

var progressCallback = function(loaded, total) {
  // do something on upgrade progress
};

var loadCompleteCallback = function() {
  // do something on finish
};

$public.ApplicationLifecycle.listen({
  onUpgradeProgress: isUpgrading ? progressCallback : null,
  onLoadComplete: loadCompleteCallback
});
```

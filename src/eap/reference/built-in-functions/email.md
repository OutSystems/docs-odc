# Email

## EmailAddressCreate

Returns a full email address string containing the display name (usually it's the name of the email address owner) and the email address itself. The resulting full email address may then be used in the Send Email element (action flows) or in the Send Email activity (process flows).

Available in:  

  * Server-side logic: Yes
  * Client-side logic: No
  * Database: Function is evaluated before the aggregate is executed.

The display name of the email address which usually is the name of the email address owner as, for example, "John Smith".

email
:    Type: Text. Mandatory.  
The email address itself, for example, john.smith@example.com.

Type: Text

```
EmailAddressCreate("John Smith", "john.smith​@​example.com") = "John Smith" <john.smith​@example.com>
EmailAddressCreate("Mary Jones", "mary.jones​@example.com") = "Mary Jones" <mary.jones​@example.com>
```

## EmailAddressValidate

Returns true if Text 'address' is a valid email address. Note that EmailAddressValidate("") returns True.  
This built-in function implements the validation specified by HTML5 (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address) which has a practical approach to RFC 5322.  

Available in:  

  * Server-side logic: Yes
  * Client-side logic: Yes
  * Database: Function is evaluated before the aggregate is executed.

### Parameters

address
:    Type: Text. Mandatory.  
The email address to validate.

### Output

Type: Boolean  

### Examples

```
EmailAddressValidate(EmailAddressCreate("John Smith", "john.smith​@example.com")) = True
EmailAddressValidate("John Smith <john.smith​@​>") = False
```

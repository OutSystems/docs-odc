# Built-in functions

When designing the business logic of your apps, you can use built-in functions. They are available in the **Built-in Functions** folder of the expression editor.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Built-in functions are designed to avoid raising exceptions when executed. If an issue occurs during the execution of a built-in function, OutSystems returns the default value of the output data type.

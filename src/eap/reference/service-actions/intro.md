# Service actions

Service actions are reusable code components that can be called from any app, providing an efficient way to perform specific tasks such as accessing data, sending emails, making API calls, integrating with an AI agent. For detailed information, refer to [Service actions](../../app-architecture/service-actions.md).

OutSystems supports service actions for integrating with the AI agent builder. They are available in:

**Service Actions > AIAgentBuilder > CallAgentV2.** folder in the Logic tab in ODC Studio.

# Debugging apps

Debug your app in ODC Studio by pausing the execution at [breakpoints](breakpoints.md), specific points in an app, and then running the logic step-by-step. This lets you find any issues in your logic design.

The [Debugger tab](debugger-ui-reference.md) shows app information like variable and runtime values. It also shows the current debugging context (current [thread](threads.md), event name, UI flow, screen and action, when applicable. Use the debugger commands available in the Debugger Toolbar and in the Debugger menu.

When debugging an action in your library, ensure that the app is using the most recent version, as there may be multiple versions of the library; otherwise, a warning occurs. Stepping into a Service Action from a consumer app isn't supported.

## How to debug your app

**Note**: Debugging your app is only possible in the Development stage.

To debug your app, do the following in ODC Studio:

1. Click the **1-Click Publish** button to save the latest changes in the app before debugging. 

1. Set one or more [breakpoints](breakpoints.md) in the app you're debugging.

1. Before debugging a **native mobile app**, choose a debugging target in the [Debugger tab](debugger-ui-reference.md): Android, iOS, or Google Chrome which emulates a device. The section [Mobile Debugging Scenarios](#mobile-debugging-scenarios) includes further details about the different targets. If you're debugging a **mobile app distributed as a PWA**, select **Emulate using Google Chrome** in **Debugger** > **Debug Setup**. 

1. Start debugger by clicking the **Start Debugging** button in the [Debugger tab](debugger-ui-reference.md). When you're debugging mobile apps using the Google Chrome target, ODC Studio opens a dedicated Chrome browser instance for debugging only.

1. Do some tasks in the app, up to a point when the execution runs into a breakpoint and suspends.

1. When you switch to the ODC Studio window, the flow containing the element with the breakpoint shows on the canvas. ODC Studio selects the element with the breakpoint and marks is with the ![Icon indicating an active debug request on an element within ODC Studio](images/overlay-active-request.png "Debug Icon") debug icon.

1. The execution context shows in the **Threads** tab of the **Debugger** tab, marked with the ![Icon indicating an active debug request on an element within ODC Studio](images/overlay-active-request.png "Debug Icon") current thread icon, showing the current execution stack of the app elements. The **Debugger** tab also shows additional information you can explore.

1. After analyzing the runtime values at that execution point, you can continue running the app by:

    * Selecting one of the commands available for advancing the execution of the application logic: ![Icon for the Continue command in the ODC Studio Debugger Toolbar](images/toolbar-button-continue.png "Continue Command Icon") **Continue**, ![Icon for the Step Over command in the ODC Studio Debugger Toolbar](images/toolbar-button-step-over.png "Step Over Command Icon") **Step Over**, ![Icon for the Step Into command in the ODC Studio Debugger Toolbar](images/toolbar-button-step-into.png "Step Into Command Icon") **Step Into** or ![Icon for the Step Out command in the ODC Studio Debugger Toolbar](images/toolbar-button-step-out.png "Step Out Command Icon") **Step Out**. The execution point advances according to the command you run.

    * Right-clicking an element on the canvas (or in the app tree) and selecting the **Continue To Here** option in the context menu. The execution continues until it reaches that element on the canvas.

## Mobile debugging scenarios { #mobile-debugging-scenarios }

There are different ways of debugging a mobile app that help you discover, understand, and fix issues. You can debug your mobile app in one of the following ways:

**Emulate the mobile app using the Google Chrome browser in your PC**

Use the Chrome browser on your computer to debug your mobile app if you don't need to execute native plugins, as the native plugins can't run on a personal computer. This option is convenient to test the logic of the app. However, to check the performance or experience of the mobile app, test your app on a real device. Also consider this scenario if all the native plugins in the mobile app have action wrappers defined that return mock data when the plugin isn't available.

**Install the mobile app on a device**
    
Test the mobile app directly on a device as your users would run it. It's the best place to test the performance and experience of your app. You can do it on an iOS or Android device. Generate the native app package for your app in ODC Studio using the `Debug` (Android) or `Development` (iOS) build type, install it on the device, and follow the steps below according to your mobile device platform. 

* **To test a mobile app on an iOS device**:
    
    1. On your **Windows computer**, install [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/).

    1. On your **device**, turn the **Web Inspector** option **On**. 
    
        For detailed instructions, refer to [Troubleshoot Debugger Connection Issues](troubleshoot-debugger-connection.md#web-inspector-is-not-enabled-on-your-device).

    1. Connect your mobile device to the **computer** using a USB cable.

        The **Trust This Computer** popup is displayed on your device.

    1. Click **Trust** to allow debugging on the device.
    
* **To test a mobile app on an Android device:**
    
    1. On your **device**, turn [USB debugging On](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html#enable).

    1. Connect your mobile device to the computer using a USB cable.

        The **Allow USB debugging** popup is displayed.

    1. Click **Allow** to allow debugging on your device.
    
    For more information, refer to [Troubleshoot Debugger Connection Issues](troubleshoot-debugger-connection.md).

If you need to troubleshoot app crashes, a plugin, or check the native code of apps, debug your apps with the mobile platform's native tools, such as Android Studio for Android and Xcode for iOS. Before debugging using the native tools, you must generate a mobile package with `Debug` (Android) or `Development` (iOS) build type.

## Working with dates and times

When debugging an app and checking the values of the Date Time data type, keep in mind the following:

* During debugging, ODC Studio shows UTC date and time in the debugger.
* In the client UI, the date and time are in the timezone of the client.
* On the server, the date and time are in the timezone of the server.

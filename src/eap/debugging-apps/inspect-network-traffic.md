# Inspect network traffic

Use network traffic inspection when you need to examine the details of network requests generated by your mobile app and the responses sent back to the app.

For example, you can check what resources load on your first visit, monitor the over-the-air update process of a mobile app, or simulate intermittent or slow network conditions.

## Network traffic inspection options

To inspect network traffic in your apps, you can use the following options:

* Chrome or Safari Developer Tools

* Network proxy tools:

    * **[HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.com/)** - Free and open-source tool for Android and iOS, for debugging, testing, and building with HTTP(S). HTTP Toolkit provides one-click mobile app interception for both Android and iOS devices, with features including:
        * Automatic HTTPS interception with zero configuration
        * Full request and response inspection
        * Request breakpoints and editing
        * Mock responses for testing

    * **[Mitmweb](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/tools-mitmweb/)** - This free tool requires more setup than others. You can follow the official [documentation](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/) for setup instructions.

    * **[Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)** - Web debugging proxy app (Windows, macOS, Linux - also available for iOS)

## Simulate degraded network conditions

Use network condition simulation to investigate bugs that occur only intermittently or under poor network conditions. Chrome Developer Tools allow you to simulate slow networks, while a tool like Charles also allows you to simulate an unreliable network (dropping packets).

### Using Chrome DevTools

When inspecting an Android mobile app using the Chrome DevTools:

1. Connect your device and [start Android debug bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).
1. In the **Network** tab, change the network profile to use one of the predefined presets, or create your own custom network profile.

### Charles proxy

Here are the official docs on using [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/using-charles/).

The tool Charles proxy offers [bandwidth throttling and reliability settings](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/proxying/throttling/) to simulate different network conditions.

### Using iOS network link conditioner

If you have Xcode installed on your MAC, you can set up custom profiles to throttle network traffic on your device. For detailed information, refer to [Optimization with Testing](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide/TestingPerformance.html#:~:text=on%20development%20devices.-,Network%20Link%20Conditioner,-You%20can%20use).

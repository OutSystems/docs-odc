# Swipe Events

You can use the Swipe Events UI Pattern to enable swiping on a specific widget.

## How to use the Swipe Events UI Pattern

The following example shows how you can use the Swipe Events UI pattern to increase (swipe right) and decrease (swipe left) a number.

1. In ODC Studio, in the Toolbox, search for  `Swipe Events`.

    The Swipe Events widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of the Swipe Events widget in the ODC Studio Toolbox](images/swipeevents-1-ss.png "Swipe Events Widget in ODC Studio Toolbox")

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Swipe Events widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

1. Add a local variable by right-clicking on your screen name and selecting **Add Local Variable**.

1. Enter a name, a data type, and a default value for the new variable. In this example, we enter `Number`, `Integer`, and `0` repsectively.

1. Drag the new variable into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Container widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen and on the **Properties** tab, enter a name. In this example we enter `SwipeContainer`. We also add the text `Swipe left or right` inside the Container widget.

    ![Container widget named 'SwipeContainer' with text 'Swipe left or right' added to the main content area](images/swipeevents-6-ss.png "Adding Container Widget with Swipe Instructions")

1. From the **Widget Tree**, select the Swipe Events widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **WidgetId** drop-down, select the Id of the container you just created. In this example, we select **SwipeContainer.Id**.

    ![Selecting SwipeContainer.Id from the WidgetId drop-down in the properties of the Swipe Events widget](images/swipeevents-7-ss.png "Linking Swipe Events Widget to Container")

1. To set the action for when the user swipes left, remaining on the **Properties** tab, from the **SwipeLeft Handler** drop-down, select **New Client Action**.

    ![Choosing 'New Client Action' from the SwipeLeft Handler drop-down in the Swipe Events widget properties](images/swipeevents-8-ss.png "Setting Swipe Left Action in Properties")

1. Assign the relevant logic you want the swipe left action to perform. In this example, we want the number to decrease by 1 every time the user swipes left. To do this, we drag an Assign onto the client action, set the **Variable** to **Number**, and enter ``Number - 1`` for the **Value**.

    ![Assigning logic to decrease the number variable by 1 on swipe left action in the client action flow](images/swipeevents-9-ss.png "Configuring Swipe Left Logic")

1. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the **SwipeRightHandler** and so that the number increases when the user swipes right, enter `Number + 1`.

After following these steps and publishing the app, you can test the pattern in your app.

## Properties

**Property** |  **Description** |

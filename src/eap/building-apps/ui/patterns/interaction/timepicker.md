# Time Picker

You can use the Time Picker UI Pattern to allow users input a time of day in either a 24-hour or AM/PM format. The Time Picker Pattern is based on the [flatpickr library](https://flatpickr.js.org/) For more advanced options, you can refer to this library.

## How to use the Time Picker UI Pattern

1. In ODC Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Time Picker`.
    
    The Time Picker widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of the Time Picker widget in the ODC Studio Toolbox](images/timepicker-widget-ss.png "Time Picker Widget in ODC Studio Toolbox")

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Time Picker widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![Dragging the Time Picker widget into the Main Content area of an application screen](images/timepicker-widget-drag-ss.png "Dragging Time Picker Widget to Screen")

    By default, the Time Picker contains an **Input** widget (type Text).

1. Create a variable by selecting the **Input** widget, and, on the **Properties** tab, select **New Local Variable** from the **Variable** dropdown.

    This variable stores any value entered into or received by the input widget.

1. Enter a name for the variable (in this example **TimeVar**) and select **Time** as the **Data Type**.

1. Right-click your main screen and add another local variable.

    This variable stores the time selected by the user.

1. Enter a name for the variable (in this example **TimePicked**) and select **Time** as the **Data Type**.

1. To create an **OnSelect** event for the Time Picker, select the widget and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Handler** dropdown, select **New Client Action**.

1. To access the time selected by the user, create an **Assign** and set the **TimePicked** to **SelectedTime**.

    ![Creating an Assign to set the TimePicked variable to the SelectedTime](images/timepicker-assign-ss.png "Creating an Assign for Time Selection")

1. You can configure the Time Picker by selecting the pattern, and on the **Properties** tab, set the relevant (optional) properties. For more configurations, expand the **OptionalConfigs** property.

After following these steps and publishing the app, you can test the pattern in your app.

# Stacked Cards

You can use Stacked Cards UI Pattern to add swipeable cards that can be dragged in multiple directions triggering events, such as deny, approve, and archive. This pattern is ideal when you want to individually scan multiple cards.

## How to use the Stacked Cards Pattern

1. In ODC Studio, in the Toolbox, search for  `Stacked Cards`.

    The Stacked Cards widget is displayed.

    ![Screenshot showing the Stacked Cards widget in the ODC Studio Toolbox](images/stackedcards-2-ss.png "Stacked Cards Widget in ODC Studio Toolbox")

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Swipe Events widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    By default, the Stacked Cards widget contains a List, Overlay Top, Overlay Right, and Overlay Left placeholders.

1. Add content to the List placeholder. In this example, from the **Data** tab, we drag a list of Employees into the List placeholder.

    The **GetEmployees** aggregate is automatically created.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Icon widget into the OverlayTop placeholder, and from the Pick an Icon editor, choose an icon. Click **Select**.

1. Repeat step 4 for the OverlayRight and OverlayLeft placeholders.

    ![Screenshot of icons added to OverlayRight and OverlayLeft placeholders in Stacked Cards](images/stackedcards-7-ss.png "Icons for OverlayRight and OverlayLeft Placeholders")

1. To create a swipe action for the OverlayLeft placeholder, select the pattern, and from the OnLeftSwipe **Handler** drop-down, select **New Client Action**.

    ![Screenshot of selecting a new client action for the OnLeftSwipe handler in Stacked Cards](images/stackedcards-8-ss.png "Creating Swipe Action for OverlayLeft")

1. From the Toolbox, drag a **Run Server Action** onto the client action, and from the **Select Action** editor, navigate to the action you want the swipe left action to perform. In this example, we use the **DeleteEmployee** action.

    ![Screenshot of dragging a Run Server Action onto the client action for swipe left in Stacked Cards](images/stackedcards-9-ss.png "Configuring Swipe Left Action")

1. From the **Id** drop-down, select the action Id. In this example, the Id is the currently selected employee. This means, that when the user swipes left, the currently selected user is deleted form the list of employees.

1. Repeat step 7 for the OverlayTop (swipe up) and OverLayRight (swipe right) placeholders.

1. From the **Properties** tab, you can change the Stacked Card's look and feel by setting the (optional) properties.

After following these steps and publishing the app, you can test the pattern in your app.

# Month Picker

You can use the Month Picker UI Pattern to allow users input a month of the year. The Month Picker Pattern is based on the [flatpickr library](https://flatpickr.js.org/) For more advanced options, you can refer to this library.

## How to use the Month Picker UI Pattern

1. In ODC Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Month Picker`.
    
    The Month Picker widget is displayed.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Month Picker widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![Dragging the Month Picker widget into the Main Content area of an application screen](images/monthpicker-dragwidget-ss.png "Drag Month Picker Widget to Screen")

    By default, the Month Picker contains an **Input** widget (type Text).

1. Create a local variable by selecting the Input widget, and, on the **Properties** tab, select **New Local Variable** from the **Variable** dropdown.

    This variable stores any value entered into or received by the input widget.

1. Enter a name for the variable (in this example **MonthVar**) and select **Text** as the **Data Type**.

1. Right-click your main screen and add another local variable.

    This variable stores the month selected by the user.

1. Enter a name for the variable (in this example **MonthPicked**) and select **MonthYear** as the **Data Type**.

1. To create an **OnSelect** event for the Month Picker, select the Month Picker widget, and on the **Properties** tab, from the **Handler** dropdown, select **New Client Action**.

1. To access the month selected by the user, create an **Assign** and set the **MonthPicked** to **SelectedMonth**.

1. You can configure the Month Picker by selecting the pattern, and on the **Properties** tab, set the relevant (optional) properties.

After following these steps and publishing the app, you can test the pattern in your app.

You can use the [FormatDateTime](../../../../reference/built-in-functions/format.md#formatdatetime) function to specify a format for the date and time. 

</div>

# Create logic to register a user

Once you create a screen for users to sign in, you can add logic to your screen. Logic enables you to validate your user's input and set up actions if the information is true or false.

If this is the first time you are creating the logic for self-registration, then follow all the procedures. If you are making updates to your existing app, jump to the task you want to do.
  
To create logic to register users, follow these procedures. To make it easier, The procedure is divided into sections.

## Setting up the Server action

1. From the **Interface** tab, select the **Common** > **Signup**, and then on the canvas, click the **Signup** button to display the Properties panel.

    * **Id** as `NullIdentifier()`

## Validate the input

As a best practice, OutSystems recommends that you validate the information you are requesting users to input. This helps to ensure you are getting the information you expect from users.

You can check that the data entry fields only allow user data that complies with the app’s terms such as emails, names, and usernames.

### Checking for invalid emails

1. From the Toolbox, drag an **If** widget after the IsSuccess assign element.
1. In the Properties panel of the widget, set the Label as IsInvalidEmail? and the Condition as StartUserRegistration.UserRegistrationResult.StartUserRegistrationFailureReason.InvalidEmail
1. From the Toolbox, drag an **Assign** widget into the True branch.
1. Under the **Assignments** tab, assign a variable ErrorMessage as `Invalid Email`.

### Checking for invalid names

1. From the Toolbox, drag an **If** widget into the False branch.
1. In the Properties panel of the widget, set the Label as IsInvalidName? and the Condition as StartUserRegistration.UserRegistrationResult.StartUserRegistrationFailureReason.InvalidName
1. From the Toolbox, drag an **Assign** widget into the True branch.
1. Under the **Assignments** tab, assign a variable ErrorMessage as `Invalid Name`.

### Checking for a unique username

1. From the Toolbox, drag an **If** widget into the False branch.
1. In the Properties panel of the widget, set the Label as UsernameAlreadyExists? And the Condition as StartUserRegistration.UserRegistrationResult.StartUserRegistrationFailureReason.UserAlreadyRegistered
1. From the Toolbox, drag an **Assign** widget into the True branch.
1. Under the **Assignments** tab, assign a variable ErrorMessage as `User already exists. Try to recover your password`.

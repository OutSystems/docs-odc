# Create email to send verification code

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Before you begin creating your email, make sure you have an [email provider configured](../../../configuration-management/configure-emails.md).

</div>

This article describes creating an email to send to the person registering to use your app. First, you start an email with a verification code that the person must enter on the form. To make this task easier and quicker, OutSystems provides you with a sample email. To create your email, copy the email and then make the following updates.

## Creating the email

Follow these steps to create your own email.

1. From the **Interface** tab, click **UI Flows**. Then from the Emails copy and paste the **ResetPassword** email into the same folder. This creates a copy of the Reset password in the emails folder named ResetPassword2.
1. In the **Elements** tab, select Emails, and rename the email **ResetPassword2** to `UserRegistration`.
1. From **Emails**, click **UserRegistration**, then modify the **Subject** in the properties panel, for example, `Welcome to Your Sample App`.
1. On the canvas, click on the text above the unique verification code. Then in properties, replace the text.

    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    You're receiving this e-mail because you requested a password reset for your user account. To set a new password, use the button below or insert the following verification code in the reset password page.
    
    </div>

    New note text:

    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    Thank you for joining us. Weâ€™re glad to have you on board. You're receiving this e-mail because you registered in our _Your Name_ Portal. You now have a verification code.
    
    </div>

1. On the canvas, click on the text below the unique verification code. Then in Properties, replace the text.
    
    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    This verification code expires in 1 hour.

    </div>
    
    New note text:

# Screen templates

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to the OutSystems UI framework only.

</div>

Screen templates enable you to create [Screens](../screen-about.md) with predefined layouts, widgets, components, styles, and logic. The screens you create from the built-in screen templates have sample data. Having sample data in the screen is a good way to see how the screen is designed and to get inspired for developing your app.

Screen templates help you develop faster. For example, create a work order template and make it onto a Screen that shows the statuses of your project tasks. You can change the Screens by [dropping](replace-data.md) an Entity over the widget. When the entity changes, ODC Studio updates the user interface.

ODC Studio comes with the default screen templates that are based on the OutSystems UI Framework.

# Forge

Forge is a repository of reusable software assets such as libraries, web apps, and mobile apps. Available to OutSystems developers, partners, prospects, and customers, Forge powers app development with high-quality assets. The shared assets in Forge help members overcome technical challenges and help to solve business use cases.

OutSystems provides guidance to document and submit your asset for approval by OutSystems. Documenting and submitting your assets for approval helps to ensure the assets usability and increases usage by other Forge members. The Forge self-service model helps increase the number of solutions available to the community.

The following is a list of apps and libraries you can share in Forge:

* **Apps** are fully working apps for different use cases that you can customize.
* **Libraries** enable you to extend the capabilities of your apps.
    * **Integrations and connectors** - to connect to external systems, other than OutSystems, to enable other functionality.
    * **Capabilities** - such as plugins to extend your app such as a camera plugin for a mobile app.
    * **UI Patterns and UI Themes** - to use patterns and widgets that can improve navigating your app.
    * **Development tools** - to support the app lifecycle management.
    * **Templates. demos, and samples** - to view examples that show how you might use specific capabilities.
    * **Mobile Plugins** - to extend your app, such as a camera plugin.

## Asset availability

To ensure assets work as provided, OutSystems ensures that:

* Documentation is available, that it explains how  to use the asset, and the benefits the asset provides.
* Forge standards are followed

Once the asset is in Forge, it's available for all users.

 If a Forge asset gets updated, an **Update** button displays on the asset in Forge. To use the most recent changes, you should update the asset.

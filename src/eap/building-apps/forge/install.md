# Install or update a Forge asset

Forge assets become available only after they go through a submission and approval process. Once an asset is in Forge, users can install it in their organization. The asset is then accessible in ODC Studio. The label displays additional information on the details page. A Forge asset can have any of the following labels.

| Label / button | Description                                                                               |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install        | The asset is ready to install                                                             |
| Installing     | The asset is installing                                                                   |
| Installed      | The asset is installed and is ready to use                                                |
| Update         | The asset has an update that hasn't yet been installed in your organization’s environment |
| Updating       | The asset is updating                                                                      |

Following are procedures to Install and Update a Forge asset.

A panel also displays in the bottom-right corner of the screen and shows all the assets and direct dependencies being installed and the installation status of each. When the installation successfully completes, an **Installed** label displays on the card and in the panel. If an installation fails, the **Failed** label displays in the panel.

    </div>

## Install an updated Forge asset

Occasionally, an asset owner makes updates to an asset that you already installed. If the asset has updates available, the **Update** button displays. In this case, you should update your asset so you can benefit from the latest changes. Follow the steps below to update an already installed asset.

1. Do one of the following:

    * From the Forge assets card, click **Update**.

For more information, you can click on the label to display the error.

    </div>

1. To use the asset, open it in ODC Studio.

## Modify an installed Forge asset

Although Forge provides reusable assets to help you build your apps, you might want to make changes to an asset. For example, you might want to modify an asset to change a connector that better meets your organization's needs.

When you install a Forge asset from the ODC Portal, the asset is automatically locked. You can’t edit Forge assets, but you can make changes by cloning the original asset. Your original Forge asset continues to be available in your tenant. If you have references to the original Forge asset, You might want to consider updating the  references to your cloned asset.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Remember, cloned assets aren't supported. You lose the benefit of being able to easily take advantage of updates once you create your clone.

</div>

When you attempt to open a Forge asset in ODC Studio, a prompt displays asking if you want to create a clone. The clone is a duplicate of the original asset, but it’s no longer related to the original asset. OutSystems recommends using a naming convention that includes the word **clone** and a number such as **clone_#_of_name_of _asset**. You can publish cloned assets in your tenant. Once you publish your app, you can reference it as well.

If a new version of the original asset becomes available and has functionality you want to use and modify, you must copy it to your clone. To identify the differences between clone_1 (your original clone) and the updated Forge asset, you can use OutSystems **Compare and merge with another version** function. To use this function, you must create a clone of the updated asset. Then you can compare clone_1 to clone_2. The result shows where the differences exist. Then, you can make the changes to clone_1.

Sometimes, documentation for a Forge asset includes the contact information for the owner. If the Forge asset owner is listed, you can contact them and discuss the updates you want to make.

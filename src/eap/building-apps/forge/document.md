# Document your Forge asset

Before sharing a new Forge asset, OutSystems recommends that you provide documentation. Use this document to help you determine what to include, such as what your asset does,how to install and set up the asset.

## Best practices

Keep the following in mind as you create your documentation.

 * Write to the level the majority of your audience understands, don't use slang, jargon, or terms they may not understand.
* Use the active voice to create less wordy sentences.
* Be explicit, provide clarity and detail.
* Repeat terms if they correspond to repeated actions.
* Use visual aids whenever needed, but keep in mind that images are harder to maintain than text.

## Write the Introduction

An introduction helps the reader to understand how they might use this asset. Include the following: 

* What it is and why you would use this asset, focusing on its benefits.
* How to use this asset focusing on the options available.
* A good description of all functionality that the asset provides.
* A good description of how you can access the functionality from either ODC Portal or ODC Studio.
* An example that illustrates the functionality, following an end-to-end use case.
* Visual aids to add context when describing functionality or use cases. (This could be something like a flow diagram.)
* Links to additional content with important information that may lead to even more insightful information.

## Write the Forge asset installation and setup information

Use the following guidelines when writing procedures for installing and setting up your asset.

* A list of pre-requisites, if any, and access to the pre-requisite documentation.
* Numbered steps with visual aids on how to install the asset.
    * A single action per step. One step = one action.
    * Keep procedures to between 7 and 10 steps. If more than 10 steps then create another procedure.
* If the installation requires interaction with more than one tool, create a procedure for each tool.
* Separate setup procedures from the installation procedures.
 * Use Visual aids whenever the step isn't obvious.
    * If you are using images, and need to identify information, use arrows or other design elements.
    * Identify the exact location in the screen in which users need to interact.

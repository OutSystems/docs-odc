# Build AI-powered apps

Automate business processes, enhance productivity, and enable new user experience patterns by integrating AI into your business using OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC). ODC provides a platform that combines low-code development with AI integration features, simplifying the creation of AI-enhanced solutions. Incorporating AI into your ODC apps and workflows enables capabilities such as:

* Respond dynamically to changing conditions in real time.  
* Generate personalized and relevant content on demand.  
* Inject AI-driven insights and decision-making into business workflows.  
* Facilitate interactions through natural language.
* Orchestrate complex tasks and workflows autonomously.


ODC offers built-in tools to help you incorporate these AI functionalities. The platform enables you to use large language models (LLMs) through AI models and AI agents. You can connect these models with your organizational data through integrated search services, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). You can also configure AI-driven behaviors and manage the overall process. This lets you add intelligence to your app logic and user interfaces.

## Choosing your AI tool

ODC provides access to AI models in the ODC Portal through native support for AI models and agents and the [AI Agent Builder via Forge](../use-ai/intro.md). Both enhance apps with AI capabilities but differ in their range of functions and ideal use cases. Understanding these differences helps you select the appropriate tool for your needs.

OutSystems recommends using native support for AI models and agents whenever they fit your use cases. This article guides you in evaluating your use cases to help you decide when to use native support for AI models and agents versus the AI Agent Builder.

### AI models

AI models are available in the ODC Portal. They are best suited for integrating AI capabilities into **pre-defined processes** or app logic. In this approach, your app orchestrates the steps, fetches any necessary data, which can be real-time data, and passes it as context to the model. The model then performs tasks like analysis or generation based on the provided context, supporting a relatively **limited or pre-defined set of requests**.

Use cases suited for this approach include: 

* Analyzing historical sales data or survey results **provided as context** to identify trends and insights.
* Generating articles, brainstorming ideas, or creating marketing content based on **provided context**.  
* Providing personalized recommendations using historical user data **supplied by the app**.  
* Summarizing key points from real-time meeting transcripts **provided by the app**.  
* Answering user queries based on product documentation **and** current user status information **fetched by the app and passed as context**.

### AI agents 

AI agents handle more complex and autonomous tasks directly within your low-code environment. They can independently manage multi-step workflows, interact with various systems and data sources, and make decisions based on their defined objectives and the information they gather. You can extend their capabilities by connecting them to external tools (custom MCP servers or prebuilt connectors). See [External tools](tools/intro.md) for an overview and, if needed, the implementation details for [MCP servers](tools/mcp-connectors.md).

Use cases suited for AI agents include:

* Intelligent automation of customer service inquiries, autonomously accessing knowledge bases, processing information, and resolving issues.  
* Dynamic inventory monitoring and automated low-stock alerts.  
* Automated data aggregation and report generation from internal data sources.
* Automatic intake of supplier quotes by processing complex supplier quotes for clinical studies, extracting data, populating a budget workbook, comparing against rate sheets, and providing feedback/error reporting.  
* Accelerate equity research report creation in the financial industry by collecting and ingesting data from various sources, reducing report writing time.

### External tools

External tools let agents invoke functionality that lives outside your ODC appsâ€”either through custom MCP servers you host or prebuilt connectors (such as SerpAPI). Start with the [External tools overview](tools/intro.md) to choose the right approach. For detailed MCP server setup, see [MCP servers](tools/mcp-connectors.md).

## Monitoring Agentic apps

ODC facilitates the development and management of intelligent apps. ODC provides a dedicated **app analytics dashboard** to monitor the performance, usage, and errors of your deployed apps. This dashboard offers key metrics such as **health score, top apps by usage, request volume and rate, error counts and rates, and response times**. It provides a comprehensive overview of app performance. For detailed insights into user engagement, feature utilization, and performance trends across different geographies and browsers, refer to the [Monitor assets with ODC Analytics](../../monitor-and-troubleshoot/app-health.md). It also provides specific element and AI model metrics.

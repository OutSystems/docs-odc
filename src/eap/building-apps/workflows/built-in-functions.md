# Built-in functions for workflows

Just as [built-in functions](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/reference/outsystems_language/logic/built_in_functions/) are used in app development, they are also available when creating workflows. During workflow implementation, expressions can be applied in various scenarios, including decision conditions, inputs for service actions, and parameters or messages for human activities

# Terminate a workflow

When implementing your workflow, you can use a **Terminate** node to stop the workflow execution.Â 

When a **Terminate** node is reached in a workflow:

1. Any ongoing activities (except automatic activities) are interrupted and their status changes to **Terminated**.

1. Any ongoing automatic activities are executed. Once finished, their status changes to either **Completed** or **Error**.

1. The workflow instance status changes to **Done**.

# DELETE statement in ANSI-92 queries

```sql
DELETE FROM entity
[ WHERE condition ]
```

`DELETE` deletes records in an entity on an external system.
If the `WHERE` clause isn't specified, the operation will delete all records in the entity.
If the `WHERE` clause is specified, the operation will only delete records for which the boolean expression evaluates to true.
`DELETE` never returns a result.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

* The user configured on the connection must have permission to delete records in the entity on the external system.

</div>

## Examples

```sql
-- Delete all records in an entity
DELETE FROM {entity};

-- Delete only matching records in an entity
DELETE FROM {entity} WHERE {entity}.[id] = 1 OR {entity}.[id] = @dynamic;
```FROM { entity } WHERE [id] = 1 OR [id] = @dynamic;
```

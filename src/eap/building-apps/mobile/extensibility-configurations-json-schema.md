# Extensibility configurations JSON schema

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies only to mobile apps.

</div>

The **Extensibility Configurations** field provides additional settings as a JSON string. You can change a number of settings in the user interface of the IDE, such as the name of the app. Some advanced settings are available in the **Extensibility Configurations** only (for example, adding custom mobile plugins). You can edit **Extensibility Configurations** in the properties of your home module.

## Property schema

The value of the **Extensibility Configurations** property of a mobile app module is a JSON object. What follows is the JSON schema outlining the most common options. There may be other options applicable in your use case, if the feature you're using provides them.

```javascript
{
    "plugin": {
        // Use only one the following ways to reference a plugin
        "url": "<The url to a public git repository containing your plugin>",
        // or
        "identifier": "<The identifier for your plugin>",
        // If the plugin requires additional settings
        "variables": [
            {
                "name": "<The attribute name for your plugin variable>",
                "value": "<The attribute value for your plugin variable>"
            },
            /* ...more variables, if needed... */
        ]
    },
    "preferences": {
        // Common preferences for iOS and Android, like status bar customization settings
        "global": [
            {
                "name": "<The preference name for your Android/iOS application>",
                "value": "<The preference value for your Android/iOS application>"
            },
            /* ...more global preferences... */
        ],
        // Just for Android
        "android": [
            {
                "name": "<The preference name for your Android application>",
                "value": "<The preference value for your Android application>"
            },
            /* ...more Android preferences... */
        ],
        // Just for iOS
        "ios": [
            {
                "name": "<The preference name for your iOS application>",
                "value": "<The preference value for your iOS application>"
            },
            /* ...more iOS preferences... */
        ]
    },
    "icons": { ... },
    "splashscreens": { ... }
}
```

## Preferences

The following section provides more details about the options you can use in the `preferences` top-level property. For a comprehensive list of the available settings, see [preferences in Config.xml](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/dev/config_ref/index.html#preference) by Apache Cordova.

For full list, see [Cocoa Keys](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW1) and filter by UsageDescription. For an example, see information about [iOS usage descriptions](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service_Versions/MABS_7_Release_notes#ios-usage-descriptions) in the release notes. |
| AddUploadWidgetPermissions      | Android, iOS        | true       | Set as false to skip adding permissions required by the upload widget to AndroidManifest.xml and/or Info.plist. For an example, see information about [Upload widget permissions](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service_Versions/MABS_7_Release_notes#upload-widget-permissions) in the release notes. |
| EnableRefererHeaderCustomScheme | iOS        | false       | Set to true to inject the `Referer: URL` in the requests of the native app, where `URL` is the app domain.         |

## Constraints

To ensure the platform can build your app successfully and that your app works correctly, keep in mind the following restraints for the **Extensibility Configurations** JSON.

### Generic

Generic constants, applicable to all parts of the **Extensibility Configurations** JSON.

* The JSON schema and key/value pairs must follow the structure described in this topic.

* The first-level key/value pairs are optional and their order is not relevant.

* Write the name of each name/value pair using lowercase letters because the JSON is case-sensitive.

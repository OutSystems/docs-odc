# Mobile apps

OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) lets you create mobile apps fast. A mobile app is a software app developed specifically for use with a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet. With OutSystems for mobile, you can build:

* A mobile app: These are apps that users install on their phones, have access to the device sensors, can work offline, and have a UX designed for a native experience.
* A progressive web app (PWA): These are apps that users can access from their mobile browsers without installation.
* Mobile backend: Use OutSystems as the backend for your native mobile app, without using the traditional programming tools.

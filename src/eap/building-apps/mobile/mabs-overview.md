# Capacitor and Cordova support in MABS

Mobile App Build Service (MABS) is an OutSystems cloud service that generates native mobile app packages for iOS and Android from an ODC mobile app.

MABS supports different versions. Each is designed to be compatible with specific Android and iOS versions while supporting new mobile technology stacks. For detailed information about the list of supported MABS versions, refer to [Mobile Apps Build Service Versions](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service_Versions). 

MABS versions earlier than 12.0 use Apache Cordova as its underlying hybrid framework.

## Dual stack support in MABS 12

MABS 12 supports building both **Cordova apps** and [**Capacitor apps**](https://capacitorjs.com/). From ODC Portal, while building the mobile package, you can [select the mobile framework](creating-mobile-package.md) Cordova or Capacitor. The default framework for MABS 12 is Capacitor.

Here are some recommendations for building mobile apps using MABS 12:

* **For new apps:**  To leverage the modern framework and its capabilities, use the Capacitor stack from the beginning and adapt or create any necessary plugins to work with it. For detailed information about what's changing from Cordova to Capacitor apps, refer to [Changes from Cordova to Capacitor apps](intro.md#changes-from-cordova-to-capacitor-apps).
  
For detailed information about how to build a Capacitor plugin, refer to [How to build a Capacitor plugin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtPcZy19-XqsTfNuCKtpg-G4I_XEmp-2uhHhcbpE7Cg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.oebpf6wacdvm).
  
* **For existing Cordova apps with a tight deadline:** Continue with the Cordova stack and prepare for transition to Capacitor framework. 
  
* **For existing Cordova apps in a regular maintenance or improvement cycle:** Try the Capacitor stack, identify any plugin incompatibilities, and gradually work on the migration. For detailed information about how to migrate plugins to Capacitor, refer to [Migrate plugins to Capacitor](../../integration-with-systems/mobile-plugins/migrate-cordova-plugin.md). Creating new mobile plugins for Capacitor is similar to building Cordova plugins, with some Capacitor-specific changes.

## Migrating existing apps to Capacitor

Existing mobile apps using Cordova donâ€™t require immediate action. Apart from those introduced by new SDKs, there are no breaking changes for existing Cordova apps.

To migrate, your existing apps to Capacitor you must:

* Reconfigure your extensibility with [Universal Extensibility](extensibility-configurations.md).
* Use [build actions](build-actions.md) for native project customizations.
* Identify any plugin incompatibilities and migrate your existing custom plugins to Capacitor.

The transition from Cordova to Capacitor isn't expected to impact the end-user experience and mobile app performance significantly.

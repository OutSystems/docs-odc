# Customize Deeplink Behavior

Prior to MABS 9, all deeplinks handled by a mobile app caused a reload of the page. In MABS 9 this behavior was changed, and deeplinks triggered a screen navigation.

## Customizing the behavior

You can customize the deeplink behavior using the `DeepLinksHandlerType` preference in the [extensibility configurations](extensibility-configurations-json-schema.md). The preference can have 4 different values:
* `default`: performs a screen navigation to the URL *(the default behavior)*
* `event`: fires an event to the `OSDeepLinksHandlerChannel` *(does not navigate)*
* `function`: calls the `handleOpenURL` function *(does not navigate)*
* `legacy`: loads the URL in the webview directly, which performs a page reload *(the behavior from MABS 8 and earlier)*

In order to use the `event` and `function` options, the specific handler must be defined in a script loaded by the app module.

Example for `event`:
```
var channel = cordova.require("cordova/channel");
if (channel) {
    channel.OSDeepLinksHandlerChannel.subscribe(function (url) {
        ...
    });
}
```

Example for `function`:
```
window.handleOpenURL = function (url) {
    ...
}
```

## Distribution

To make this change available for the users, [publish and generate a new mobile application](<./creating-mobile-package.md>) and distribute it.

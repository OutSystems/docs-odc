# Mobile UI framework

The **Mobile UI framework** is a UI framework toolkit (a collection of reusable UI widgets) for building mobile apps in ODC Studio. It provides mobile-specific widgets designed for mobile interfaces, addressing common development challenges such as touch interaction, device compatibility, and responsive layouts.

The framework includes widgets with built-in mobile behaviors (such as Bottom Sheet and OTP Input), configurable design patterns, and a flexible styling system using CSS variables and utility classes. It supports mobile apps that need to function across different mobile devices and screen sizes.

Use the Mobile UI framework when building mobile apps with a long-term app strategy, where user experience, modern design, and fast development are top priorities.

To help you choose between Mobile UI and OutSystems UI frameworks when building your apps, refer to [Mobile UI versus OutSystems UI](framework-comparison.md).

## Key features

The Mobile UI framework provides a comprehensive set of tools and components for mobile app development:

* Widget library with capabilities such as loading states, validation feedback, touch gestures, and animation effects.

* Modern, mobile-first design system with pre-defined patterns, spacing, typography, and color schemes optimized for mobile interfaces.

* Flexible styling architecture using CSS variables, utility classes, and configurable widget properties for easy customization.

* Native mobile behaviors including automatic keyboard type selection for inputs, haptic feedback integration, and expanded clickable areas for improved touch interaction. Adaptive layouts automatically handle device-specific features such as status bars and safe areas around notches (for example, screen cut-outs for cameras).

* Modern design patterns and components that adhere to current mobile interface standards, offering a contemporary look and feel for mobile apps.

## Benefits of using the Mobile UI framework

* Eliminates the need to implement common UI patterns from scratch by providing pre-built components such as buttons with loading states, form validation widgets, and responsive navigation.

* Reduces mobile development complexity with built-in behaviors that handle touch target sizing for accessibility, loading states during async operations, and screen density adjustments without additional configuration. Optimized rendering ensures smooth, responsive interactions across devices.

* Provides automatic updates and improvements when performance enhancements or platform support are released, without requiring individual component modifications or extensive testing.

* Includes comprehensive built-in functionality for common use cases, such as input widgets with labels, helper messages, icons, character counters, clear buttons, and keyboard types, eliminating manual implementation.

* Offers integrated badge support across multiple component types (avatars, bottom bar items, buttons) with automatic placement and styling when you enable the badge property.

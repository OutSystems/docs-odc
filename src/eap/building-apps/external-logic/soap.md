# Supporting SOAP in ODC

You can use Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) web services to extend your code in OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC). This document provides an example of creating a library to consume a SOAP web service in ODC. This article assumes you know C#, .NET and SOAP. 

You can download the [SOAP template](https://github.com/OutSystems/OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK-templates/blob/main/soap_template.zip), a C# project designed for calculating the sum and subtraction of two numbers using SOAP web services. You can also download the [provided SOAP demo OML](resources/SOAP-Demo.oml), an example OutSystems app with external logic implemented.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the necessary prerequisites to [extend your apps with external logic](README.md#Prerequisites). Next, launch an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports building .NET projects, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. Open the extensions marketplace within the IDE and search for the following extensions. Install them once you find them:

* C# (extension id: ms-dotnettools.csharp)
* NuGet Package Manager GUI (extension id: aliasadidev.nugetpackagemanagergui)

### Install .NET tools to create a library

Select the folder in which you want to create your SOAP integration. Create a folder and give it a descriptive name, such as `how-to-soap`. Then go to the IDE terminal and enter the following command:
`cd path-to/<your-folder>`

1. To work with SOAP web services using the command line, install the WCF dotnet-svcutil tool for .NET. Run the following command to ensure you have the WCF dotnet-svcutil tool installed.

    `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-svcutil`

2. To add the dependencies, use either the terminal or NuGet Package Manager GUI. Then install the following dependency:

    `dotnet add package OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK`

## Consume SOAP web service as an external library in ODC

To create a library that consumes a SOAP web service, follow this process:

1. [Create OutSystems external library](#create-outsystems-external-library)
2. [Upload the library to ODC Portal](#upload-the-library-to-odc-portal)
3. [Use the actions from the library to consume the SOAP web service](#use-the-external-library-in-odc-studio)

## Create OutSystems external library

To create an OutSystems external library that consumes a SOAP web service in C#, follow this process:

1. [Set up the project](#set-up-the-project)
2. [Define the interface of the method](#define-the-interface-of-the-method)
3. [Import the image resources](#import-the-image-resources)
4. [Add the calculator SOAP web service](#add-the-calculator-soap-web-service)
5. [Call the SOAP web service](#call-the-soap-web-service)
6. [Release the SOAP web service](#release-the-soap-web-service)

### Set up the project

To install your web service and create the structures to be used by the interface, follow these steps:

1. To install your web service using svcutil, open the IDE terminal and run the following command.

    `dotnet-svcutil https://<YOUR WSDL>`

    <div class="info" markdown="1">

    You can use a free [SOAP WSDL](https://ecs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/Handouts/cse775/code/calcWebService/Calc.asmx) available for testing. If the SOAP service you want to use is on a private network you can use the [Private Gateway feature](../../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/private-gateway.md) to connect to it, see the [SDK README](README.md#use-with-the-private-gateway-feature) for guidance.

    </div>

2. To create your library using the class library template, run the following code. Give the project a name, such as `ConsumeSOAPExample`, and select **.NET 8.0 (Long-term support)** as the framework.

    `dotnet new classlib --language "C#" --framework "net8.0" -o ConsumeSOAPExample`

3. Create a new folder named `Structures` inside the ConsumeSoapExample folder. Create a new file called `Numbers.cs` within the Structures folder. Then copy and paste the following code to create and map the structures as OutSystems structures.
    
        using OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK;
    
        namespace ConsumeSOAPExample.Structures 
        {
            // Its exposed as a structure to your ODC apps and libraries.
            [OSStructure(Description = "Number A & B")]
            public struct Numbers 
            {
                // Gets Number A & B to do the sum.
                [OSStructureField(DataType = OSDataType.Integer, Description = "Number A.", IsMandatory = true)]
                public int NumberA;
    
                [OSStructureField(DataType = OSDataType.Integer, Description = "Number B.", IsMandatory = true)]
                public int NumberB;
            }
        }

In the previous code, you defined a structure with two integer attributes (NumberA and NumberB). To learn more, see [available data types in the custom code SDK](README.md#usage).

### Define the interface of the method

To define the method interface, follow these steps:

1. Add the following dependencies:
    
        using System.Xml;
        using System.ServiceModel;
        using ServiceReference;
        using OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK;
        using ConsumeSOAPExample.Structures;
    
2. Rename the file from `Class1.cs` to `ConsumeSOAPExample.cs`.

3. Add an interface named `ICalculator` before the class in the namespace.

        namespace ConsumeSOAPExample 
        {
            public interface ICalculator
            {
    
            }
            public class Class1
            {
                
            }
        }

4. Add the custom code attributes from the OutSystems External Libraries SDK before the interface. 
   
        namespace ConsumeSOAPExample 
        {
            /* In this case, the OSInterface attribute provides information about the Calculator interface to the ODC,
                which uses this information to create an integration layer with a SOAP web service. */
            [OSInterface(Description = "Consume a Free SOAP web service in OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC).", IconResourceName = "ConsumeSOAPExample.Resources.SOAP.jpg", Name = "SOAP")]
            public interface ICalculator
            {
            }
        }

5. Inside the interface, add the two methods that represent the web service's methods.

        // This method is exposed as a server action to your ODC apps and libraries.
        [OSAction(Description = "The sum method takes two numbers as input parameters and returns their sum.", IconResourceName = "ConsumeSOAPExample.Resources.SOAP.jpg", ReturnName = "sum")]
        int Sum(
            [OSParameter(Description = "Number A & B as an integer")] Structures.Numbers numbers
        );
        // This method is exposed as a server action to your ODC apps and libraries.
        [OSAction(Description = "The subtraction method takes two numbers as input parameters and calculates the difference between the first number and the second number.", IconResourceName = "ConsumeSOAPExample.Resources.SOAP.jpg", ReturnName = "sub")]
        int Subtract(
            [OSParameter(Description = "Number A & B as an integer")] Structures.Numbers numbers
        );


### Import the image resources

The interface includes icon resources located in the [resources folder of the provided project](https://github.com/OutSystems/OutSystems.ExternalLibraries.SDK-templates/tree/main/templates/soap/ConsumeSOAPExample/Resources). To import these resources, follow these steps:

1. After you download the icons into your project, create a new folder and name it `Resources`. Then upload the icons to the Resource folder.

2. To add these resources to the project, open **ConsumeSOAPExample.csproj** and add the following code inside the ItemGroup tag:
    
        <EmbeddedResource Include="Resources\SOAP.jpg" /> 
        
### Add the calculator SOAP web service

To add the calculator SOAP web service, name the class `Calculator` and the interface `ICalculator`.  

    namespace ConsumeSOAPExample 
    {
        ...
        public class Calculator : ICalculator
        {
            ...
        }
    }

### Call the SOAP web service

To call the SOAP web service, follow these steps:

1. In the **ICalculator**. Define the necessary properties for calling the SOAP web service.

        // Add calculator web service Soap Channel
        private static readonly string ENDPOINTADDRESS = "<https://ecs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/Handouts/cse775/code/calcWebService/Calc.asmx>";
        private static readonly int TIMEOUT = 1000;
        private readonly BasicHttpBinding _binding;
        private readonly EndpointAddress_address;

2. To create the request and add the properties for the BasicHttpBinding.

    * Define properties for the BasicHttpBinding.
    * Define the security mode and endpoint address by adding the following lines after the BasicHttpBinding object. Add the following code:
    
            public class Calculator : ICalculator 
            {
                public Calculator()
                {
                    _binding = new BasicHttpBinding
                    {
                        SendTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(TIMEOUT),
                        MaxBufferSize = int.MaxValue,
                        MaxReceivedMessageSize = int.MaxValue,
                        AllowCookies = true,
                        ReaderQuotas = XmlDictionaryReaderQuotas.Max,
                        Security = new BasicHttpSecurity
                        {
                        Mode = BasicHttpSecurityMode.Transport
                        }
                    };
                    _address = new EndpointAddress(ENDPOINTADDRESS);
                }
            }
    
3. To use the add method to perform a sum, define a private asynchronous method called **AddAsync** that takes in a single parameter of type Numbers. 
    * To simplify the method, you can use two input parameters. This template showcases the usage of structures.
    * The first parameter is an object of type Numbers (defined in the OutSystems.SOAP.Structures namespace), and it contains two integers, `NumberA` and `NumberB`. 
    * The second parameter is an output parameter of type int that contains the sum of NumberA and NumberB.
    * The method returns a Task &#60;int&#62; object, a wrapper for the result of the asynchronous operation defined in the SOAP web service. Add the following code: 

            public int Sum(Numbers numbers)
            {
                /* This line calls the AddAsync method (defined later in the code), which asynchronously calls a SOAP service to add NumberA and NumberB.Once the result is returned, it is stored in the sum variable. */
                return AddAsync(numbers).Result;
            }
            private async Task<int> AddAsync(Numbers numbers)
            {
                /* This line creates a new instance of the CalculatorWebServiceSoapClient class, which is generated by dotnet-svcutil when you add a reference to a SOAP service. The using statement ensures that the proxy is properly disposed of when the method completes. */      
                using (var proxy = new CalculatorWebServiceSoapClient(_binding, _address))
                {
                    /* This line asynchronously calls the AddAsync method of the CalculatorWebServiceSoapClient class, passing in NumberA and NumberB from the numbers parameter. The await keyword suspends the execution of the method until the result is returned from the service. */
                    var result = await proxy.AddAsync(numbers.NumberA, numbers.NumberB);
                    return result;
                }
            }

4. 	To use the Subtract method to perform a subtraction, define a private asynchronous method called **SubAsync** that takes a single parameter of type Numbers.
    * The input parameter is a structure that contains two numbers and returns the subtraction of those two numbers.
    * The first parameter is an object of type Numbers (defined in the OutSystems.SOAP.Structures namespace) and contains two integers, `NumberA` and `NumberB`. 
    * The second parameter is an output parameter of type int that contains the sub of NumberA and NumberB. 
    * The method returns a Task &#60;int&#62; object, a wrapper for the result of the asynchronous operation defined in the SOAP web service. Add the following code: 
            
            public int Subtract(Numbers numbers)
            {
                /* This line calls the AddAsync method (defined later in the code), which asynchronously calls a SOAP service to add NumberA and NumberB.Once the result is returned, it is stored in the sum variable. */
                return SubtractAsync(numbers).Result;
            }
            private async Task<int> SubtractAsync(Numbers numbers)
            {
                /* This line creates a new instance of the CalculatorWebServiceSoapClient class, which is generated by dotnet-svcutil when you add a reference to a SOAP service. The using statement ensures that the proxy is properly disposed of when the method completes. */      
                using (var proxy = new CalculatorWebServiceSoapClient(_binding, _address))
                {
                    /* This line asynchronously calls the AddAsync method of the CalculatorWebServiceSoapClient class, passing in NumberA and NumberB from the numbers parameter. The await keyword suspends the execution of the method until the result is returned from the service. */
                    var result = await proxy.SubtractAsync(numbers.NumberA, numbers.NumberB);
                    return result;
                }
            }
    
### Release the SOAP web service

1. Once you finish the code, save the project and publish it. For example, right-click **ConsumeSOAPExample** and select **Open in Terminal**. Run the command, 
    ` dotnet publish -c Release `
2. Zip the published output folder (for example, ConsumeSOAPExample > bin > Release > net8.0 > publish) to the root folder of a ZIP file. For example, `ExternalLibrary.zip` is the name of your external library.

## Upload the library to ODC Portal

Once you have the SOAP zip file, [upload and publish the external logic](intro.md#Upload-and-publish-the-external-logic) in ODC.

## Use the external library in ODC Studio

After uploading the SOAP web service to ODC, create an application called `SOAP Demo` in ODC Studio to test the web service.

1. Click the **Logic tab**, right-click the top Server action, and select the option to **Add a public element**. Then inside **All sources**, search for a dependency called `SOAP` and select the **Add**, **Subtract** actions and the **Numbers** structure. 
   ![Screenshot showing the process of adding public elements in OutSystems Developer Cloud Studio](images/add-public-elements-odcs.png "Adding Public Elements in ODC Studio")

2. Create a screen and name it `Calculator` with two inputs. Set both local variables as integers, name them `NumA` and `NumB`. Place a plus sign (+) between these two inputs and an equal sign (=) after the last input.

3. Create another local variable as an integer and name it `Sum`. Drag an expression in the canvas and add the **Sum** variable below the equal sign.

4. Drag a button below the expression and name it `Calculate`. In the **On Click** list, select **New Client Action** and name it `OnClick_Sum`. A screen opens for editing.
    
    ![User interface of the Calculator screen in OutSystems Developer Cloud Studio with input fields and calculate button](images/calculator-screen-odcs.png "Calculator Screen in ODC Studio")

5. Inside the **OnClick_Sum** client action, go to the **Logic** tab > **Server actions** > **SOAP** 
    1. Drag the **Add action** to the flow and rename it `SumFunction`.
    2. In the Properties for the Add action, click **(+)** sign to expand numbers, and inside add your local variables, the `NumberA` and `NumberB` attributes.
    
    ![Configuration of the OnClick_Sum client action in OutSystems Developer Cloud Studio](images/client-action-odcs.png "Client Action Configuration in ODC Studio")

6. Drag an assign and set the local variable **Sum** with the output of the **SumFunction** to get the sum of both numbers and present it to the screen.
7. Publish the app and see the result in the browser.


<div class="info" markdown="1">

To test it faster, go to the **screen properties** > **Authorization** and set the **Accessible by** the property to **Everyone**. This allows any user to test it without a log in. Also, when you click the **calculate** button for the first time, it might take a few seconds to get the response.

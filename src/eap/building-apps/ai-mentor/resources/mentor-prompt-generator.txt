**Entity Relationships:**

* [Describe relationships using One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, or One-to-One]

#### Data type reference

Use these specific data types:

* **Identifier**: Primary keys, foreign keys, bridging entities
* **Text**: Names, descriptions, addresses, free-form notes
* **Boolean**: True/false flags (IsActive, RequiresApproval)
* **DateTime**: Timestamps, scheduled dates, deadlines

#### Validation rule types

Mentor supports these validation types:

* **Mandatory**: Field must have a value
* **Past date**: Date must be in the past
* **Future date**: Date must be in the future
* **Value range**: Numeric value must be within specified minimum/maximum
* **Text length**: Text must not exceed specified character limit
* **Email format**: Must be a valid email address format
* **Phone format**: Must be a valid phone number format

#### Static entities

For lookup/reference data:

**Entity Name: [StaticEntityName]**
Purpose: [Explain what this lookup represents]
Records: [List all enumerated values, comma-separated]

### 4. Roles and permissions (Required)

For each role:

**Role: [RoleName]**

* [EntityName]: [Full Access / Edit Access / View Access]
* [EntityName]: [Full Access / Edit Access / View Access]
* Special permissions: [Any row-level rules or ownership-based restrictions]

### 5. Stateflows (If applicable)

For entities with lifecycle states, define the stateflow:

**Entity: [EntityName]**

**Statuses:** [List all possible statuses, e.g., Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected]

**Transitions:**

* [FromStatus] → [ToStatus]: [Conditions - which roles can perform, required attributes]
* [FromStatus] → [ToStatus]: [Conditions]

**Example:**

**Entity: Request**

**Statuses:** Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Approved, Rejected

**Transitions:**

* Draft → Submitted: Requester role, all mandatory fields must be filled
* Submitted → Under Review: Reviewer role
* Under Review → Approved: Manager role, requires ApprovalNotes attribute
* Under Review → Rejected: Manager role, requires RejectionReason attribute
* Rejected → Draft: Requester role (allows resubmission)

### 6. Main features and screens (Required)

List each screen with:

* Screen name and purpose
* Screen type/pattern (see pattern reference below)
* Key features and interactions
* Navigation flow
* Business logic requirements

#### Screen pattern reference

Choose patterns based on data characteristics:

| Pattern | Use when | Constraints |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Table | Dense tabular comparison with many columns | Avoid for mobile or visual summaries |
| Card list | Scanning records with key fields and tags | Better than table for fewer columns |
| Card gallery | Image or media-heavy datasets | Requires image attribute |
| List with popup | Simple entities, quick edit/view | Only for entities with 5 or fewer non-ID attributes |
| Master detail | Browse and inspect records simultaneously | Table portion limited to 5 attributes; use card list for more |
| Card list with detail in sidebar | Frequent detail editing while keeping list context | Good for workflows |
| Card list with map | Location-based decisions | Requires address or coordinate attributes |
| Dashboard | High-level KPIs, metrics, and data visualization | Not for detailed record editing |

**Pattern constraints:**

* Popup pattern: Only available for entities with 5 or fewer non-ID attributes. Entities exceeding this limit should use table pattern.
* Master detail with table: Limited to 5 attributes in the list portion. For more attributes, specify card list or gallery.
* Entities with dependents: Cannot use popup or master-detail patterns. Dependent entities have a single foreign key reference to the target entity.

#### Using tabs

For screens with related content, specify tab organization:

* Tab 1: [Tab name] - [Content description]
* Tab 2: [Tab name] - [Content description]

**Example:**

**Screen: Customer Detail**

* Type: Master detail with tabs
* Purpose: View and edit customer information with related data
* Tabs:
    * Profile: Customer attributes (Name, Email, Phone, Address)
    * Orders: List of related Order records
    * Notes: Customer notes and comments
* Business logic: Show only active customers by default

**Example:**

**Screen: Product Catalog**

* Type: Card Gallery
* Purpose: Display all active products with search and filter
* Features: Search by name, filter by category, click to view details
* Business logic: Only show products where IsActive = true

### 7. Dashboards (If applicable)

Specify dashboard components clearly.

#### Supported components

**Counters:** Display key metrics prominently
**Charts:** Visualize data trends and distributions
**Lists:** Display up to 5 records (top items, most recent, etc.)

#### Supported chart types

* Vertical Bar Chart
* Horizontal Bar Chart
* Line Chart
* Pie Chart
* Donut Chart
* Area Chart

#### Aggregation functions

Specify how metrics are calculated:

* **Count**: Total number of records
* **Sum**: Total of a numeric field across records
* **Avg**: Average value of a numeric field
* **Max**: Maximum value of a numeric field
* **Min**: Minimum value of a numeric field

#### Column layouts

Dashboards support these arrangements:

* **Equal columns**: 2 to 6 columns with equal width
* **Asymmetric 2:1**: Two-thirds and one-third width
* **Asymmetric 3:1**: Three-quarters and one-quarter width

Note: Narrow columns in asymmetric layouts cannot contain list sections.

**Dashboard specification format:**

**Dashboard should consist of:**

* [Metric name] as a counter ([Aggregation function])
* [Metric name] as a counter ([Aggregation function])
* [Chart title] as a [Chart type] showing [data breakdown] ([Aggregation function])
* [List title] as a list showing [criteria, e.g., "most recent 5 orders"]

**Layout:** [Specify column arrangement if not default]

**Example:**

**Dashboard should consist of:**

* Total Orders as a counter (Count)
* Total Revenue as a counter (Sum of OrderValue)
* Orders by Status as a Donut Chart (Count grouped by Status)
* Revenue by Month as a Vertical Bar Chart (Sum of OrderValue grouped by Month)
* Recent Orders as a list showing most recent 5 orders

**Layout:** 3 equal columns for counters, full width for charts

### 8. External integrations (Optional)

If applicable:

* External system name and purpose
* Data flow direction (inbound/outbound/bidirectional)
* Key data elements exchanged
* Integration frequency or trigger

**Example:**
"Customer data is sourced from Salesforce via REST API. Sync occurs nightly for new and updated customer records."

## Quality guidelines

### Include

* Detailed entity definitions with explicit data types
* Clear relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
* Validation rules for data integrity
* Stateflows for entities with lifecycle states
* Functional requirements describing what the app should do
* Specific UI layouts and screen patterns
* Dashboard specifications with chart types and aggregation functions
* Business logic and workflow rules
* Entity-level and row-level access control

### Avoid

* Implementation code or code snippets
* References to screenshots or embedded images
* Complex nested tables (use simple lists instead)
* Ambiguous language ("user-friendly", "intuitive", "easy to use")
* Technical jargon without context
* Vague requirements

### Clarity standards

* Use specific, concrete language
* Define acronyms on first use
* Provide examples where helpful
* Be explicit about constraints and validation rules
* State assumptions clearly
* Write in English (recommended for best results with Mentor)

## Additional instructions

1. **Fill in gaps intelligently**: If artifacts are incomplete, make reasonable assumptions based on common patterns but note them clearly
1. **Consolidate information**: If multiple artifacts cover the same topic, synthesize into a cohesive description
1. **Resolve conflicts**: If artifacts contradict each other, flag the conflict and propose the most logical resolution
1. **Maintain business perspective**: Focus on what the app should do (business logic) rather than how to implement it (technical details)
1. **Be comprehensive**: Include all entities, relationships, screens, and permissions even if not explicitly stated but clearly implied
1. **Apply pattern constraints**: When recommending screen patterns, respect the constraints (e.g., popup only for entities with 5 or fewer non-ID attributes)

## Output format

Generate the requirement document in a clean, readable format using:

* Clear section headers
* Bullet points for lists
* Consistent formatting
* Proper spacing between sections

The document should be ready to upload to OutSystems Mentor as a .txt, .docx, or .pdf file (maximum 5 MB).

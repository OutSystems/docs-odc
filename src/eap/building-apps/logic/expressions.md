# Expressions

An expression consists of operands and operators, or just one operand. For example, **n + 1** is an expression with two operands, **n** and **1**, joined by the addition operator +. 

Here is how you can edit expressions and show the expression values.

* Use the [expression editor](expressions/expression-editor.md) to **edit expressions**. The expression editor shows you available elements. It automatically completes the text and shows suggestions after you press **Ctrl+Space**.

* **Edit expressions** inline in the properties of elements.

* To **show the result** of an expression, use the Expression widget. This is similar to the **print** command in other programming languages.

## Notes

Here are some tips for using expressions.

* You can use  many functions to manipulate the type Text, however, you can only use the  **+** (addition) operand with type Text. 

    Example: `"Hello, " + UserName`, where the value of **UserName** is **Billy**, returns `"Hello, Billy!"`. 

* You can use the [built-in functions](../../reference/built-in-functions/dateandtime.md) or use the [libraries](../../reference/libraries/datetime.md) to perform various operations on the types **Date**, **Time**, and **DateTime**.

    Example: `AddDays(#2020-01-01 00:00:00#, 90)`. **AddDays** is a function that adds **n** days to a Date Time value. Date Time is here a literal `#2020-01-01 00:00:00#`. The expression returns `#2020-03-31 00:00:00#`.

* You can only use the operators **=** and **&lt;&gt;** (equality operators) for the type `Record`.

* For the type **Identifier**, use the [built-in functions](../../reference/built-in-functions/data-conversion.md). 

* The types **BinaryData** and **Record List** don't support calculations.

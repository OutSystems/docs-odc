# On Application Ready

Your app runs the **On Application Ready** during the loading of the app. Use **On Application Ready** to set up the app, for example, to initialize variables and mobile plugins.

**On Application Ready** action runs synchronously and blocks the screen render. When navigating to an app for the first time, the accessed screen renders only after **On Application Ready** completes.

After the first execution, navigations between screens from the same app don't trigger **On Application Ready**. This includes navigating to other screens using External Site or Destination or navigating back to a previous screen. However, if you navigate to a screen of a different app, the **On Application Ready** of that app is executed.

Note that if the user types or refreshes the URL of a screen directly in the browser address bar, **On Application Ready** is executed. This causes the corresponding app to reload.

To add the **On Application Ready** action to a Mobile or Web App do the following in ODC Studio:

1. In your app, open the **Logic** tab.

1. Right-click the **Client Actions** node in the tree and select **Add System Event** > **On Application Ready**.

# Using the AI Agent Builder 

With AI Agent Builder, you can combine AI model, instructions, additional data sources to create agents for a specific use case. You can then integrate the agent into your existing app to build generative AI applications. You also have the option to choose from a variety of [sample apps](intro.md#sample-apps) that closely matches your use case and download the OML. The OML file consists of entities, screens, call to an Agent, and an integration template for the external solutions in the app, such as Zendesk for Salesforce.

You can assign the following end user roles to manage the AI Agent Builder:

* **AIAgentBuilder**: Gives access to the AI Agent Builder and can create/manage agents but do not have permissions to create AI models and data sources.

* **Configurator**: Gives full access to the AI Agent Builder and can create/manage agents, AI models and data sources.

This article explains the overall process of using the AI agent builder to build generative AI applications.

# Testing apps

As your applications grow in scale and complexity, validating them can take longer, especially if validation is manual. If not addressed, more time for testing can slow the pace of delivery. Automated testing is one way software teams can shorten delivery timelines and ensure application code works as designed.

OutSystems provides tools, guidance, and best practices for implementing automated testing in your environment.

## Component testing with BDDFramework tools

Component testing is the process of testing Actions and exposed Services that make up an application's logic. Component testing in OutSystems spans multiple test types, including unit, integration, and API tests. BDDFramework is the recommended tool for planning and executing component testing. The following resources provide more information.

* [Component testing with BDDFramework tools](testing-bdd-framework.md) -- Introduction to BDDFramework tools that includes installation and getting started steps
* [Your Complete Guide to BDD Testing in OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/bdd-testing/) -- Comprehensive blog post describing how to use the BDDFramework for server-side testing.

## Web UI testing

Considerations and best practices for [web UI testing](automated-testing/web-ui-testing.md) cover design patters and considerations for choosing a testing tool and designing tests.

## More information and training

# Install or update a Forge asset

Forge assets become available only after they go through a submission and approval process. Once an asset is in Forge, users can install it in their organization. The asset is then accessible in ODC Studio. The label displays additional information on the details page. A Forge asset can have any of the following labels.

| Label / button | Description                                                                               |

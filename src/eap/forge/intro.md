# Forge

Forge is a repository of reusable software assets such as libraries, web apps, and mobile apps. Available to OutSystems developers, partners, prospects, and customers, Forge powers app development with high-quality assets. The shared assets in Forge help members overcome technical challenges and help to solve business use cases.

OutSystems provides guidance to document and submit your asset for approval by OutSystems. Documenting and submitting your assets for approval helps to ensure the assets usability and increases usage by other Forge members. The Forge self-service model helps increase the number of solutions available to the community.

You can share projects such as:

* **Applications and Libraries** - fully working apps for different use cases that you can customize such as an onboarding employee app.
* **Integrations** - connections to external systems, other than OutSystems, to enable other functionality.
* **Capabilities** - plugins to extend your app such as a camera plugin for a mobile app.
* **User Interface** - patterns and widgets that can improve a UI to make it easier to navigate your app.
* **Development tools** - to support app lifecycle management.
* **Templates. Demos, and samples** - examples that show how you might use specific capabilities.

## Sharing your work

All OutSystems community members can share their work. You can create a new project or join a team and contribute to an existing project.

Before sharing your project, remember that Forge is the place for the community. Members look for  ways to accelerate their development work, or the best way to solve a specific use case.

OutSystems removes or rejects test applications or code shared with a specific small group of people. The Forge is for sharing with the all members of the community.

## Asset availability

To ensure assets work as provided, OutSystems ensures that:

* Documentation is available, that it explains how  to use the asset, and the benefits the asset provides.
* Forge standards are followed

Once the asset is in Forge, it's available for all users.

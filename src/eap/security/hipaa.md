# HIPAA compliance with ODC

This document describes how OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) can help you develop and secure your healthcare applications and data while complying with HIPAA security and privacy requirements.

OutSystems dramatically accelerates the development of secure applications, and their deployment in a secure runtime environment. OutSystems’ built-in application lifecycle management capabilities promote a clear assignment of responsibilities in the DevOps processes, laying the foundation for a secure Software Development Lifecycle.

## How ODC helps healthcare providers { #how-odc-helps }

ODC empowers healthcare providers to move to a patient-centric model by giving them the ability to rapidly build patient-facing apps for purposes such as researching their prescribed drugs, evaluating their treatment options, accessing and controlling their medical information, and more. Apps can be pushed across any platform for any device on a single code base that’s secure and HIPAA compliant.

## HIPAA compliance { #hipaa-compliance }

OutSystems applications dealing with protected health information may be subject to HIPAA compliance. Medical records and other personal health information that both:

* Identifies an individual.  
* Is maintained or exchanged electronically or in hard copy (for example, photocopied or printed from the database).

HIPAA considers such personally identifiable information protected if it's possessed by a covered entity or business associate.

The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the HIPAA Privacy Rule to implement the requirements of HIPAA. [The HIPAA Security Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) protects a subset of information covered by the Privacy Rule.

### What do I have to do to be HIPAA compliant? { #have-to-do-hipaa }

This is an overview that doesn't replace the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Customers are required to be aware and up-to-date on [Health Information Privacy](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html).

The Privacy Rule standards address the use and disclosure of individuals’ health information (known as "protected health information" or "PHI") by entities subject to the Privacy Rule. These individuals and organizations are called "covered entities". The Privacy Rule also contains standards for individuals’ rights to understand and control how their health information is used.

While the HIPAA Privacy Rule safeguards PHI, the Security Rule protects a subset of information covered by the Privacy Rule. This subset is all individually identifiable health information that a covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits in electronic form. This information is called "electronic protected health information" (ePHI).

HIPAA safeguards can result in a HIPAA violation when the standards of the HIPAA Security Rule aren’t properly followed. To maintain compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must have proper Physical, Administrative, and Technical safeguards in place to keep PHI and ePHI secure.

### HIPAA-compliant OutSystems Developer Cloud apps { #hipaa-cloud }

[Sentry for ODC](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platform/security/sentry/) enables HIPAA compliance, entitling you to:

* A [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-agreement-provisions/index.html) certifying that your OutSystems applications are compliant with HIPAA requirements. For assistance, contact your OutSystems account manager.

* Attestation by an independent auditor that OutSystems technology, cloud hosting, policies and procedures ensure that PHI is handled correctly even in the unlikely event of a data breach. See additional details in the [OutSystems Trust Center](https://security.outsystems.com/).

* [ODC audit trail](../monitor-and-troubleshoot/audit-trail.md), a feature that logs developer actions at ODC Portal.

Contact your account manager to purchase ODC Sentry. To confirm that you're using ODC Sentry, check your [Subscription console](../manage-platform-app-lifecycle/subscription-console.md). If not, contact your account manager.

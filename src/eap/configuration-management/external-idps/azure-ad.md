# Add Azure AD for use as external identity provider

ODC admins can configure Azure AD as an external IdP by going to the ODC Portal and selecting the **Identity providers** tab. 

To launch the **New provider** configuration screen, click the **Add Provider** > **OpenID Connect** button. Now follow these steps:

1. Enter a name for the new provider in the **Provider name** field. This can be any name less than 255 characters and can't include special characters.

1. Login to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) and create a new app registration in the Azure Active Directory screen. For guidance, see Microsoft documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

1. Open the app registration you created and click the **Endpoints** button. Copy the URL from the **OpenID Connect metadata document** field and paste it into the **Discovery endpoint** field in ODC Portal.

1. Click **Get details** in ODC Portal. This retrieves the JSON of the Azure AD OpenID configuration and shows a preview.

1. Copy the value of the **Application (client) ID** field from the main screen of the app registration in Azure Portal and paste it into the **Client ID** field in ODC Portal.

1. Click the **Certificates & secrets** tab from the main screen of the app registration in **Azure Portal**. Click **New client secret** button. Enter a description for the new secret in the **Description** field and then click **Add** to generate the secret.

1. Copy the newly generated value from the **Value** field and paste it into the **Client secret (secret value)** field in ODC Portal.

1. Complete the configuration in ODC Portal by leaving the **PKCE** as the default value (**SHA-256**) and fields in **Claim Mapping** section as default values (**name**, **email**) and clicking **Save**.
1. If additional Claims needs to be enabled (for e.g. in JWT Tokens via Claims Mapping Policy) in Azure AD, the extra property needs to be added in the  app manifest configuration manually (on Azure AD side). Some information on these Additional claims can be found [here](https://blog.redbaronofazure.com/?p=7566).

ODC tests the configuration and on success adds Azure AD to the list of available providers. If the test fails, a notification with the error displays. 

Now follow the steps [here](intro.md#apply-an-external-idp) to apply for the newly added Azure AD provider for use by your organization or apps.

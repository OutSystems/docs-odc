# Subscription console

The subscription console is a centralized hub for viewing application objects (AOs), end-users, and add-ons. To access the subscription console, sign in the ODC Portal, click the **Organization** dropdown, and select **Manage Subscriptions**.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

The subscription console is only accessible to administrators or developers with permission.

## Overview tab

The **Overview** tab provides visibility of the total usage of AOs and the number of internal and external end-users. 

## Application Objects tab

The [Application Objects](https://success.outsystems.com/support/licensing/application_objects/) tab provides a detailed breakdown of AOs per stage within a tenant. When you click on a specific stage, you can view the number of AOs consumed by each app within that stage. This feature aids in better managing AO usage and more effectively planning deployments.

## End-users tab

The **End-users** tab has a form for maintaining internal end-user domains and provides visibility of the number of internal and external users. 

## Add-ons tab

The **Add-ons** tab provides visibility of the add-ons to which the organization is subscribed and add-ons that are available for subscription.

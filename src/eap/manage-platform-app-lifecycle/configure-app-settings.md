If you're storing sensitive information such as passwords or an access token in the setting, set the **Is secret** property to True. For more information about the **Is secret** property, refer to [Set as Secret](../security/set-as-secret.md). For more information about settings and their properties, refer to [Setting properties](#setting-properties).

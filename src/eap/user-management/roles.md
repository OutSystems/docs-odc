# Roles and permissions for members (IT-users)

This article covers permissions for [members (IT-users)](intro.md#members-it-users) who build and manage apps in ODC. For information about end-user roles, refer to [Secure your app with end-user roles](secure-app-with-roles.md).

In ODC, you control what your members (IT-users) can do by assigning them roles. A role is a set of permissions that you can grant at the **organization** and **asset** (**app**) [**scopes**](intro.md#organization-app-stage-and-app-scope).

ODC allows implementing user access control policies on the following domains:

* Asset (apps and libraries) management
* Stage visibility
* Release management
* Application monitoring
* AI Mentor System
* Configuration and connection management
* User management
* Forge access
* Support cases management
* Subscription management

## Effective permissions calculation

Permissions are applied at the **organization** or **app stage** [scope](intro.md#organization-app-stage-and-app-scope). A user's total permissions are the sum of all roles assigned to them at both the **organization** and **asset** (**app**) [**scopes**](intro.md#organization-app-stage-and-app-scope). You can assign one role for the organization scope, and one role for each app.

![Diagram illustrating scopes with roles and permissions](images/role-permission-diag.png "Scopes for roles and permissions")

The fundamental rule is that permissions are cumulative. A role assigned at the app scope adds to the permissions granted at the organization scope.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

An app-level role can grant additional permissions for that specific app, but it can never revoke permissions a user already has from an organization-level role.

</div>

### Permission scenarios

Hereâ€™s how this principle works in practice.

**Scenario 1: A more permissive role is assigned at the app level**
:   A user has a general role for the organization but needs elevated permissions for one app:

    * Organization Role: Developer.
    * App Role: Administrator.
    * Result: The user has Developer permissions across the organization. For the specific app where they are an Administrator, they gain the additional permissions of that role. For example, they can now manage that app's configurations in Production stage, a permission the Developer role doesn't have.

**Scenario 2: A less permissive role is assigned at the app level**
:   A user has a high-level role for the organization, and a more restrictive role is assigned for one app:

    * Organization Role: **Administrator**.
    * App Role: **Developer**.
    * Result: The organization-level permissions prevail. Since app-level roles can't remove permissions, the user remains an Administrator for the entire organization, including the specific app. The Developer role at the app level has no effect.

## Types of roles for members (IT-users) { #types-of-roles }

ODC provides two types of roles for members (IT-users), built-in roles, and custom roles.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

For details on how to assign or remove roles for members, refer to [Grant and revoke user roles](grant-and-revoke-user-roles.md#grant-roles-to-members).

</div>

### Built-in roles

ODC includes two built-in organization roles:

| Role           | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Administrator  | Full access to all platform features, including user management, deployment, and configuration. |
| Developer      | Access to build and manage apps. Can invite new users and grant end-user roles, but only for the **Development** stage.|

You can't delete or modify built-in roles, but you can duplicate them to create custom roles.

To see the full list of permissions for the **Admin** or **Developer** role, in the ODC Portal, go to **Organization roles**, and then click **Admin** or **Developer**. Both roles are identified with the **Built-in role** label.

### Custom roles { #custom-roles }

You can create custom roles to tailor permissions to your organization's needs. Custom roles let you select specific [permissions](#permissions-registry) and apply them at **organization** or **app stage** [scope](intro.md#organization-app-stage-and-app-scope). After creating a custom role, you need to assign it to users either at **organization scope** or to specific **apps**. For more details on how to create custom roles and how to assign a role to a user, refer to [Create custom roles for members](#create-custom-roles-for-it-users) and [Grant or revoke roles to members](grant-and-revoke-user-roles.md#grant-roles-to-members).

For more details about recommended custom roles, refer to [Recommended custom roles for members (IT-users)](#recommended-custom-roles).

## Create custom roles for members (IT-users) { #create-custom-roles-for-it-users }

To create a custom role for members, follow these steps:

1. In the ODC Portal, under **Manage**, go to **Organization roles**.
1. Click **Create role**.
1. Enter a name for the role.
1. Select the permissions you want to assign. You may limit some [permissions](#permissions-registry) to specific stages if needed.  
1. Click **Create** to save the role.

## ODC permissions { #permissions-registry }

The following table lists the permissions you can assign to custom roles. For more details on **organization** (global) and **asset** (**app**) scope, refer to [Organization, app stage, and app scope](intro.md#organization-app-stage-and-app-scope).

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Some permissions are automatically inherited by others to ensure consistent behavior and prevent errors. When configuring custom roles in the ODC Portal, selecting a permission may automatically select additional related permissions due to these dependencies.

## Recommended custom roles for members (IT-users) { #recommended-custom-roles }

As a general guideline, you can create the following custom roles based on the scope to use when assigning roles to a member:

* **App scope**: Basic Developer, Tech Lead.
* **Organization scope**: Basic Member, Architect, Tenant Admin.

In this reference model, the **Architect** role is responsible for the ownership and lifecycle of the asset portfolio, including creating, deleting, and installing assets from Forge, as well as managing releases. The **Tenant Admin** role focuses on global infrastructure configurations, not on asset or release management. If a user needs both sets of permissions, assign the built-in **Admin** role, which combines all capabilities.  

This approach supports a DevOps-oriented model, where delivery teams (**Tech Lead** + **Developers**) have full ownership of their assigned assets (and only theirs).

The following table outlines the permissions you can configure for each of these recommended custom roles:

| Category                        | Basic Developer                                   | Tech Lead                                              | Basic                   | Architect                                         | Tenant Admin                                         |

# Stream observability data to Amazon S3

This article explains how you can stream observability data from ODC apps to **Amazon S3**.

## Prerequisites

Before streaming observability data to **Amazon S3**, ensure you have a subscription to the **App Analytics Stream**. Contact your account manager for provisioning.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Stream to Amazon S3 requires an [OpenTelemetry Collector](stream-app-analytics-opentelemetry.md) with a specific [AWS S3 contrib exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awss3exporter#aws-s3-exporter-for-opentelemetry-collector/). As of June 2024, the [AWS S3 contrib exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awss3exporter#aws-s3-exporter-for-opentelemetry-collector/) is in [Alpha stability](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#alpha/). Customers are advised to assess their use case and learn more before adopting it.

## Set up streaming observability data to Amazon S3

To set up streaming observability data, using **Amazon S3** as the destination storage, follow these steps:

1. Set up the [OpenTelemetry Collector](stream-app-analytics-opentelemetry.md).

1. Configure a receiver that accepts HTTP or gRPC connections and uses the [AWS S3 contrib exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/awss3exporter#aws-s3-exporter-for-opentelemetry-collector/).

1. Get the OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint and authentication credentials.

Once you've completed these steps, go to the ODC Portal and [configure a stream](stream-app-analytics-configure.md).Â

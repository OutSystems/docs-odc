# Unused action in app or library

An action that isn't used in an app or library and is also not exposed to other apps or libraries (non-public action).

## Impact

Unused actions can enlarge your code, make maintenance difficult, and increase security risks.

## Why is this happening? 

The app or library does not utilize the defined action anywhere.

## How to fix

Consider deleting the action if it isn't strictly necessary.

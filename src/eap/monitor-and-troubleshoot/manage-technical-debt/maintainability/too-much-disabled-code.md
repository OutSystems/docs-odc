# Too much disabled code

An app containing too much disabled code.

## Impact

Keeping a large amount of disabled code creates clutter and makes it difficult to read. It also increases maintenance costs and wastes time, as people tend to interpret disabled code to better understand its relevance.

## Why is this happening?

Too much disabled code results from deactivating code sections but not removing them.Â 

## How to fix

Remove the code if you have disabled it for a while or if the app is in production and behaves correctly.

# Exposed REST services without authentication

Exposed REST services should enforce SSL/TLS, and authentication.

## Impact

Without authentication, REST endpoints are vulnerable to unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse

## Why is this happening?

The exposed REST API isn't protected. The authentication is set to **None**.

## How to fix

Change the authentication to **Basic** or **Custom** in the REST service.

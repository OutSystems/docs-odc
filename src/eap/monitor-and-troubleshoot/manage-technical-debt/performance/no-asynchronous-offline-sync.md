# No asynchronous Offline sync

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to **Mobile** apps only.

</div>

Server data isn't stored in the local database asynchronously.

## Impact

Synchronously storing server data blocks screens and/or actions that may impact the overall user experience.

## Why is this happening?Â 

This issue arises because the server data in the mobile application is stored in the local database synchronously, rather than asynchronously

## How to fix

Use TriggerOfflineDataSync to execute OfflineDataSync asynchronously and react to the OnSyncComplete event to update UI modules.

# Complex splash screen

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to **Mobile** apps only.

</div>

Keep the splash screen simple and fast by minimizing the number of requests to the server and avoiding complex UI logic. 

## Impact

A complex splash screen increases the app load time. Users may see a blank screen before the screen renders.

## Why is this happening?

The splash screen has a complex UI or has heavy/lengthy operations.

## How to fix

To lessen the slash screen loading time, avoid requests to the server and complex logic. Avoid a complex UI by keeping the number of Blocks to a minimum.

# Inefficient empty list test

Using the Count property of an Aggregate or SQL query to check if results were returned.

## Impact

For performance, the OutSystems query optimizer ensures that the output of Aggregates and advanced queries only contains the essential data to feed a screen. This means the Count property needs to execute an additional query to get the total number of registries.

## Why is this happening?

This occurs because the Count property of an Aggregate or SQL query results were returned.Â 

## How to fix

Use **List.Empty** property to test for lack of results instead of **List.Count.**
